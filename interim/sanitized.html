<h3>SCENE: Rome, the conspirators' camp near Sardis, and the plains of Philippi.</h3>
<h4>ACT I. SCENE I. Rome. A street.</h4>
<p>Enter Flavius, Marullus, and certain Commoners.</p>
<p>FLAVIUS. Hence, home, you idle creatures, get you home.</p>
<p>Is this a holiday? What, know you not,</p>
<p>Being mechanical, you ought not walk</p>
<p>Upon a laboring day without the sign</p>
<p>Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?</p>
<p>FIRST COMMONER. Why, sir, a carpenter.</p>
<p>MARULLUS. Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?</p>
<p>What dost thou with thy best apparel on?</p>
<p>You, sir, what trade are you?</p>
<p>SECOND COMMONER. Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am</p>
<p>but, as you would say, a cobbler.</p>
<p>MARULLUS. But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.</p>
<p>SECOND COMMONER. A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a</p>
<p>safe</p>
<p>conscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.</p>
<p>MARULLUS. What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what</p>
<p>trade?</p>
<p>SECOND COMMONER. Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me;</p>
<p>yet,</p>
<p>if you be out, sir, I can mend you.</p>
<p>MARULLUS. What mean'st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy</p>
<p>fellow!</p>
<p>SECOND COMMONER. Why, sir, cobble you.</p>
<p>FLAVIUS. Thou art a cobbler, art thou?</p>
<p>SECOND COMMONER. Truly, Sir, all that I live by is with the</p>
<p>awl; I</p>
<p>meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's matters, but</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>awl. I am indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes; when they are</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>great danger, I recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon</p>
<p>neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.</p>
<p>FLAVIUS. But wherefore art not in thy shop today?</p>
<p>Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?</p>
<p>SECOND COMMONER. Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes to get</p>
<p>myself</p>
<p>into more work. But indeed, sir, we make holiday to see</p>
<p>Caesar</p>
<p>and to rejoice in his triumph.</p>
<p>MARULLUS. Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?</p>
<p>What tributaries follow him to Rome</p>
<p>To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?</p>
<p>You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!</p>
<p>O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,</p>
<p>Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft</p>
<p>Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,</p>
<p>To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,</p>
<p>Your infants in your arms, and there have sat</p>
<p>The livelong day with patient expectation</p>
<p>To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.</p>
<p>And when you saw his chariot but appear,</p>
<p>Have you not made an universal shout</p>
<p>That Tiber trembled underneath her banks</p>
<p>To hear the replication of your sounds</p>
<p>Made in her concave shores?</p>
<p>And do you now put on your best attire?</p>
<p>And do you now cull out a holiday?</p>
<p>And do you now strew flowers in his way</p>
<p>That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood?</p>
<p>Be gone!</p>
<p>Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,</p>
<p>Pray to the gods to intermit the plague</p>
<p>That needs must light on this ingratitude.</p>
<p>FLAVIUS. Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,</p>
<p>Assemble all the poor men of your sort,</p>
<p>Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears</p>
<p>Into the channel, till the lowest stream</p>
<p>Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.</p>
<p>Exeunt all Commoners.</p>
<p>See whether their basest metal be not moved;</p>
<p>They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.</p>
<p>Go you down that way towards the Capitol;</p>
<p>This way will I. Disrobe the images</p>
<p>If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.</p>
<p>MARULLUS. May we do so?</p>
<p>You know it is the feast of Lupercal.</p>
<p>FLAVIUS. It is no matter; let no images</p>
<p>Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about</p>
<p>And drive away the vulgar from the streets;</p>
<p>So do you too, where you perceive them thick.</p>
<p>These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing</p>
<p>Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,</p>
<p>Who else would soar above the view of men</p>
<p>And keep us all in servile fearfulness. Exeunt.</p>
<h3>SCENE II. A public place.</h3>
<p>Flourish. Enter Caesar; Antony, for the course; Calpurnia,</p>
<p>Portia,</p>
<p>Decius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, and Casca; a great crowd</p>
<p>follows,</p>
<p>among them a Soothsayer.</p>
<p>CAESAR. Calpurnia!</p>
<p>CASCA. Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.</p>
<p>Music ceases.</p>
<p>CAESAR. Calpurnia!</p>
<p>CALPURNIA. Here, my lord.</p>
<p>CAESAR. Stand you directly in Antonio's way,</p>
<p>When he doth run his course. Antonio!</p>
<p>ANTONY. Caesar, my lord?</p>
<p>CAESAR. Forget not in your speed, Antonio,</p>
<p>To touch Calpurnia, for our elders say</p>
<p>The barren, touched in this holy chase,</p>
<p>Shake off their sterile curse.</p>
<p>ANTONY. I shall remember.</p>
<p>When Caesar says "Do this," it is perform'd.</p>
<p>CAESAR. Set on, and leave no ceremony out. Flourish.</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER. Caesar!</p>
<p>CAESAR. Ha! Who calls?</p>
<p>CASCA. Bid every noise be still. Peace yet again!</p>
<p>CAESAR. Who is it in the press that calls on me?</p>
<p>I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,</p>
<p>Cry "Caesar." Speak, Caesar is turn'd to hear.</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER. Beware the ides of March.</p>
<p>CAESAR. What man is that?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. A soothsayer you beware the ides of March.</p>
<p>CAESAR. Set him before me let me see his face.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.</p>
<p>CAESAR. What say'st thou to me now? Speak once again.</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER. Beware the ides of March.</p>
<p>CAESAR. He is a dreamer; let us leave him. Pass.</p>
<p>Sennet. Exeunt all but Brutus and Cassius.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Will you go see the order of the course?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Not I.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. I pray you, do.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. I am not gamesome; I do lack some part</p>
<p>Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.</p>
<p>Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;</p>
<p>I'll leave you.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Brutus, I do observe you now of late;</p>
<p>I have not from your eyes that gentleness</p>
<p>And show of love as I was wont to have;</p>
<p>You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand</p>
<p>Over your friend that loves you.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Cassius,</p>
<p>Be not deceived; if I have veil'd my look,</p>
<p>I turn the trouble of my countenance</p>
<p>Merely upon myself. Vexed I am</p>
<p>Of late with passions of some difference,</p>
<p>Conceptions only proper to myself,</p>
<p>Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;</p>
<p>But let not therefore my good friends be grieved-</p>
<p>Among which number, Cassius, be you one-</p>
<p>Nor construe any further my neglect</p>
<p>Than that poor Brutus with himself at war</p>
<p>Forgets the shows of love to other men.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion,</p>
<p>By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried</p>
<p>Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.</p>
<p>Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself</p>
<p>But by reflection, by some other things.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. 'Tis just,</p>
<p>And it is very much lamented, Brutus,</p>
<p>That you have no such mirrors as will turn</p>
<p>Your hidden worthiness into your eye</p>
<p>That you might see your shadow. I have heard</p>
<p>Where many of the best respect in Rome,</p>
<p>Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus</p>
<p>And groaning underneath this age's yoke,</p>
<p>Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,</p>
<p>That you would have me seek into myself</p>
<p>For that which is not in me?</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,</p>
<p>And since you know you cannot see yourself</p>
<p>So well as by reflection, I your glass</p>
<p>Will modestly discover to yourself</p>
<p>That of yourself which you yet know not of.</p>
<p>And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus;</p>
<p>Were I a common laugher, or did use</p>
<p>To stale with ordinary oaths my love</p>
<p>To every new protester, if you know</p>
<p>That I do fawn on men and hug them hard</p>
<p>And after scandal them, or if you know</p>
<p>That I profess myself in banqueting</p>
<p>To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.</p>
<p>Flourish and shout.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. What means this shouting? I do fear the people</p>
<p>Choose Caesar for their king.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Ay, do you fear it?</p>
<p>Then must I think you would not have it so.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.</p>
<p>But wherefore do you hold me here so long?</p>
<p>What is it that you would impart to me?</p>
<p>If it be aught toward the general good,</p>
<p>Set honor in one eye and death i' the other</p>
<p>And I will look on both indifferently.</p>
<p>For let the gods so speed me as I love</p>
<p>The name of honor more than I fear death.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</p>
<p>As well as I do know your outward favor.</p>
<p>Well, honor is the subject of my story.</p>
<p>I cannot tell what you and other men</p>
<p>Think of this life, but, for my single self,</p>
<p>I had as lief not be as live to be</p>
<p>In awe of such a thing as I myself.</p>
<p>I was born free as Caesar, so were you;</p>
<p>We both have fed as well, and we can both</p>
<p>Endure the winter's cold as well as he.</p>
<p>For once, upon a raw and gusty day,</p>
<p>The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</p>
<p>Caesar said to me, "Darest thou, Cassius, now</p>
<p>Leap in with me into this angry flood</p>
<p>And swim to yonder point?" Upon the word,</p>
<p>Accoutred as I was, I plunged in</p>
<p>And bade him follow. So indeed he did.</p>
<p>The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it</p>
<p>With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</p>
<p>And stemming it with hearts of controversy.</p>
<p>But ere we could arrive the point proposed,</p>
<p>Caesar cried, "Help me, Cassius, or I sink!</p>
<p>I, as Aeneas our great ancestor</p>
<p>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</p>
<p>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</p>
<p>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</p>
<p>Is now become a god, and Cassius is</p>
<p>A wretched creature and must bend his body</p>
<p>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</p>
<p>He had a fever when he was in Spain,</p>
<p>And when the fit was on him I did mark</p>
<p>How he did shake. 'Tis true, this god did shake;</p>
<p>His coward lips did from their color fly,</p>
<p>And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world</p>
<p>Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan.</p>
<p>Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans</p>
<p>Mark him and write his speeches in their books,</p>
<p>Alas, it cried, "Give me some drink, Titinius,"</p>
<p>As a sick girl. Ye gods! It doth amaze me</p>
<p>A man of such a feeble temper should</p>
<p>So get the start of the majestic world</p>
<p>And bear the palm alone. Shout. Flourish.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Another general shout!</p>
<p>I do believe that these applauses are</p>
<p>For some new honors that are heap'd on Caesar.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</p>
<p>Like a Colossus, and we petty men</p>
<p>Walk under his huge legs and peep about</p>
<p>To find ourselves dishonorable graves.</p>
<p>Men at some time are masters of their fates:</p>
<p>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,</p>
<p>But in ourselves that we are underlings.</p>
<p>Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that "Caesar"?</p>
<p>Why should that name be sounded more than yours?</p>
<p>Write them together, yours is as fair a name;</p>
<p>Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;</p>
<p>Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,</p>
<p>"Brutus" will start a spirit as soon as "Caesar."</p>
<p>Now, in the names of all the gods at once,</p>
<p>Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed</p>
<p>That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!</p>
<p>Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!</p>
<p>When went there by an age since the great flood</p>
<p>But it was famed with more than with one man?</p>
<p>When could they say till now that talk'd of Rome</p>
<p>That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?</p>
<p>Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,</p>
<p>When there is in it but one only man.</p>
<p>O, you and I have heard our fathers say</p>
<p>There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd</p>
<p>The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome</p>
<p>As easily as a king.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;</p>
<p>What you would work me to, I have some aim.</p>
<p>How I have thought of this and of these times,</p>
<p>I shall recount hereafter; for this present,</p>
<p>I would not, so with love I might entreat you,</p>
<p>Be any further moved. What you have said</p>
<p>I will consider; what you have to say</p>
<p>I will with patience hear, and find a time</p>
<p>Both meet to hear and answer such high things.</p>
<p>Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:</p>
<p>Brutus had rather be a villager</p>
<p>Than to repute himself a son of Rome</p>
<p>Under these hard conditions as this time</p>
<p>Is like to lay upon us.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. I am glad that my weak words</p>
<p>Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.</p>
<p>Re-enter Caesar and his Train.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. The games are done, and Caesar is returning.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,</p>
<p>And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you</p>
<p>What hath proceeded worthy note today.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,</p>
<p>The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,</p>
<p>And all the rest look like a chidden train:</p>
<p>Calpurnia's cheek is pale, and Cicero</p>
<p>Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes</p>
<p>As we have seen him in the Capitol,</p>
<p>Being cross'd in conference by some senators.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Casca will tell us what the matter is.</p>
<p>CAESAR. Antonio!</p>
<p>ANTONY. Caesar?</p>
<p>CAESAR. Let me have men about me that are fat,</p>
<p>Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights:</p>
<p>Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;</p>
<p>He thinks too much; such men are dangerous.</p>
<p>ANTONY. Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;</p>
<p>He is a noble Roman and well given.</p>
<p>CAESAR. Would he were fatter! But I fear him not,</p>
<p>Yet if my name were liable to fear,</p>
<p>I do not know the man I should avoid</p>
<p>So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,</p>
<p>He is a great observer, and he looks</p>
<p>Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays,</p>
<p>As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;</p>
<p>Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort</p>
<p>As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit</p>
<p>That could be moved to smile at anything.</p>
<p>Such men as he be never at heart's ease</p>
<p>Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,</p>
<p>And therefore are they very dangerous.</p>
<p>I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd</p>
<p>Than what I fear, for always I am Caesar.</p>
<p>Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,</p>
<p>And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.</p>
<p>Sennet. Exeunt Caesar and all his Train but Casca.</p>
<p>CASCA. You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today</p>
<p>That Caesar looks so sad.</p>
<p>CASCA. Why, you were with him, were you not?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.</p>
<p>CASCA. Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered</p>
<p>him,</p>
<p>he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the</p>
<p>people fell ashouting.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. What was the second noise for?</p>
<p>CASCA. Why, for that too.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?</p>
<p>CASCA. Why, for that too.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Was the crown offered him thrice?</p>
<p>CASCA. Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time</p>
<p>gentler</p>
<p>than other, and at every putting by mine honest neighbors</p>
<p>shouted.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Who offered him the crown?</p>
<p>CASCA. Why, Antony.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.</p>
<p>CASCA. I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it. It was</p>
<p>mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>crown (yet 'twas not a crown neither, 'twas one of these</p>
<p>coronets) and, as I told you, he put it by once. But for all</p>
<p>that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he</p>
<p>offered</p>
<p>it to him again; then he put it by again. But, to my</p>
<p>thinking, he</p>
<p>was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>the third time; he put it the third time by; and still as he</p>
<p>refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped</p>
<p>hands</p>
<p>and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had</p>
<p>almost choked Caesar, for he swounded and fell down at it.</p>
<p>And</p>
<p>for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my</p>
<p>lips</p>
<p>and receiving the bad air.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound?</p>
<p>CASCA. He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and</p>
<p>was</p>
<p>speechless.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. 'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,</p>
<p>And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.</p>
<p>CASCA. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar</p>
<p>fell</p>
<p>down. If the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him</p>
<p>according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to</p>
<p>do</p>
<p>the players in the theatre, I am no true man.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. What said he when he came unto himself?</p>
<p>CASCA. Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common</p>
<p>herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his</p>
<p>doublet</p>
<p>and offered them his throat to cut. An had been a man of any</p>
<p>occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he</p>
<p>came</p>
<p>to himself again, he said, if he had done or said anything</p>
<p>amiss,</p>
<p>he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity.</p>
<p>Three or</p>
<p>four wenches where I stood cried, "Alas, good soul!" and</p>
<p>forgave</p>
<p>him with all their hearts. But there's no heed to be taken of</p>
<p>them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have</p>
<p>done</p>
<p>no less.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. And after that he came, thus sad, away?</p>
<p>CASCA. Ay.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Did Cicero say anything?</p>
<p>CASCA. Ay, he spoke Greek.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. To what effect?</p>
<p>CASCA. Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look you i' the face</p>
<p>again; but those that understood him smiled at one another</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>shook their heads; but for mine own part, it was Greek to me.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for</p>
<p>pulling</p>
<p>scarfs off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you</p>
<p>well.</p>
<p>There was more foolery yet, if could remember it.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?</p>
<p>CASCA. No, I am promised forth.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Will you dine with me tomorrow?</p>
<p>CASCA. Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner</p>
<p>worth</p>
<p>the eating.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Good, I will expect you.</p>
<p>CASCA. Do so, farewell, both. Exit.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!</p>
<p>He was quick mettle when he went to school.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. So is he now in execution</p>
<p>Of any bold or noble enterprise,</p>
<p>However he puts on this tardy form.</p>
<p>This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,</p>
<p>Which gives men stomach to digest his words</p>
<p>With better appetite.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. And so it is. For this time I will leave you.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,</p>
<p>I will come home to you, or, if you will,</p>
<p>Come home to me and I will wait for you.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. I will do so. Till then, think of the world.</p>
<p>Exit Brutus.</p>
<p>Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see</p>
<p>Thy honorable mettle may be wrought</p>
<p>From that it is disposed; therefore it is meet</p>
<p>That noble minds keep ever with their likes;</p>
<p>For who so firm that cannot be seduced?</p>
<p>Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.</p>
<p>If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,</p>
<p>He should not humor me. I will this night,</p>
<p>In several hands, in at his windows throw,</p>
<p>As if they came from several citizens,</p>
<p>Writings, all tending to the great opinion</p>
<p>That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely</p>
<p>Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at.</p>
<p>And after this let Caesar seat him sure;</p>
<p>For we will shake him, or worse days endure. Exit.</p>
<h3>SCENE III. A street. Thunder and lightning.</h3>
<p>Enter, from opposite sides, Casca, with his sword drawn, and</p>
<p>Cicero.</p>
<p>CICERO. Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?</p>
<p>Why are you breathless, and why stare you so?</p>
<p>CASCA. Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth</p>
<p>Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,</p>
<p>I have seen tempests when the scolding winds</p>
<p>Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen</p>
<p>The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam</p>
<p>To be exalted with the threatening clouds,</p>
<p>But never till tonight, never till now,</p>
<p>Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.</p>
<p>Either there is a civil strife in heaven,</p>
<p>Or else the world too saucy with the gods</p>
<p>Incenses them to send destruction.</p>
<p>CICERO. Why, saw you anything more wonderful?</p>
<p>CASCA. A common slave- you know him well by sight-</p>
<p>Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn</p>
<p>Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand</p>
<p>Not sensible of fire remain'd unscorch'd.</p>
<p>Besides- I ha' not since put up my sword-</p>
<p>Against the Capitol I met a lion,</p>
<p>Who glaz'd upon me and went surly by</p>
<p>Without annoying me. And there were drawn</p>
<p>Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women</p>
<p>Transformed with their fear, who swore they saw</p>
<p>Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.</p>
<p>And yesterday the bird of night did sit</p>
<p>Even at noonday upon the marketplace,</p>
<p>Howling and shrieking. When these prodigies</p>
<p>Do so conjointly meet, let not men say</p>
<p>"These are their reasons; they are natural":</p>
<p>For I believe they are portentous things</p>
<p>Unto the climate that they point upon.</p>
<p>CICERO. Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.</p>
<p>But men may construe things after their fashion,</p>
<p>Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.</p>
<p>Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow?</p>
<p>CASCA. He doth, for he did bid Antonio</p>
<p>Send word to you he would be there tomorrow.</p>
<p>CICERO. Good then, Casca. This disturbed sky</p>
<p>Is not to walk in.</p>
<p>CASCA. Farewell, Cicero. Exit Cicero.</p>
<p>Enter Cassius.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Who's there?</p>
<p>CASCA. A Roman.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Casca, by your voice.</p>
<p>CASCA. Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!</p>
<p>CASSIUS. A very pleasing night to honest men.</p>
<p>CASCA. Who ever knew the heavens menace so?</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Those that have known the earth so full of faults.</p>
<p>For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,</p>
<p>Submitting me unto the perilous night,</p>
<p>And thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,</p>
<p>Have bared my bosom to the thunderstone;</p>
<p>And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open</p>
<p>The breast of heaven, I did present myself</p>
<p>Even in the aim and very flash of it.</p>
<p>CASCA. But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?</p>
<p>It is the part of men to fear and tremble</p>
<p>When the most mighty gods by tokens send</p>
<p>Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life</p>
<p>That should be in a Roman you do want,</p>
<p>Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze</p>
<p>And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder</p>
<p>To see the strange impatience of the heavens.</p>
<p>But if you would consider the true cause</p>
<p>Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,</p>
<p>Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,</p>
<p>Why old men, fools, and children calculate,</p>
<p>Why all these things change from their ordinance,</p>
<p>Their natures, and preformed faculties</p>
<p>To monstrous quality, why, you shall find</p>
<p>That heaven hath infused them with these spirits</p>
<p>To make them instruments of fear and warning</p>
<p>Unto some monstrous state.</p>
<p>Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man</p>
<p>Most like this dreadful night,</p>
<p>That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars</p>
<p>As doth the lion in the Capitol,</p>
<p>A man no mightier than thyself or me</p>
<p>In personal action, yet prodigious grown</p>
<p>And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.</p>
<p>CASCA. 'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Let it be who it is, for Romans now</p>
<p>Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors.</p>
<p>But, woe the while! Our fathers' minds are dead,</p>
<p>And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;</p>
<p>Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.</p>
<p>CASCA. Indeed they say the senators tomorrow</p>
<p>Mean to establish Caesar as a king,</p>
<p>And he shall wear his crown by sea and land</p>
<p>In every place save here in Italy.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. I know where I will wear this dagger then:</p>
<p>Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius.</p>
<p>Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;</p>
<p>Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.</p>
<p>Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,</p>
<p>Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron</p>
<p>Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;</p>
<p>But life, being weary of these worldly bars,</p>
<p>Never lacks power to dismiss itself.</p>
<p>If I know this, know all the world besides,</p>
<p>That part of tyranny that I do bear</p>
<p>I can shake off at pleasure. Thunder still.</p>
<p>CASCA. So can I.</p>
<p>So every bondman in his own hand bears</p>
<p>The power to cancel his captivity.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?</p>
<p>Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf</p>
<p>But that he sees the Romans are but sheep.</p>
<p>He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.</p>
<p>Those that with haste will make a mighty fire</p>
<p>Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,</p>
<p>What rubbish, and what offal, when it serves</p>
<p>For the base matter to illuminate</p>
<p>So vile a thing as Caesar? But, O grief,</p>
<p>Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this</p>
<p>Before a willing bondman; then I know</p>
<p>My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,</p>
<p>And dangers are to me indifferent.</p>
<p>CASCA. You speak to Casca, and to such a man</p>
<p>That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand.</p>
<p>Be factious for redress of all these griefs,</p>
<p>And I will set this foot of mine as far</p>
<p>As who goes farthest.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. There's a bargain made.</p>
<p>Now know you, Casca, I have moved already</p>
<p>Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans</p>
<p>To undergo with me an enterprise</p>
<p>Of honorable-dangerous consequence;</p>
<p>And I do know by this, they stay for me</p>
<p>In Pompey's Porch. For now, this fearful night,</p>
<p>There is no stir or walking in the streets,</p>
<p>And the complexion of the element</p>
<p>In favor's like the work we have in hand,</p>
<p>Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.</p>
<p>Enter Cinna.</p>
<p>CASCA. Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. 'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait;</p>
<p>He is a friend. Cinna, where haste you so?</p>
<p>CINNA. To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?</p>
<p>CASSIUS. No, it is Casca, one incorporate</p>
<p>To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?</p>
<p>CINNA. I am glad on't. What a fearful night is this!</p>
<p>There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Am I not stay'd for? Tell me.</p>
<p>CINNA. Yes, you are.</p>
<p>O Cassius, if you could</p>
<p>But win the noble Brutus to our party-</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,</p>
<p>And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,</p>
<p>Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this</p>
<p>In at his window; set this up with wax</p>
<p>Upon old Brutus' statue. All this done,</p>
<p>Repair to Pompey's Porch, where you shall find us.</p>
<p>Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?</p>
<p>CINNA. All but Metellus Cimber, and he's gone</p>
<p>To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie</p>
<p>And so bestow these papers as you bade me.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre.</p>
<p>Exit Cinna.</p>
<p>Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day</p>
<p>See Brutus at his house. Three parts of him</p>
<p>Is ours already, and the man entire</p>
<p>Upon the next encounter yields him ours.</p>
<p>CASCA. O, he sits high in all the people's hearts,</p>
<p>And that which would appear offense in us,</p>
<p>His countenance, like richest alchemy,</p>
<p>Will change to virtue and to worthiness.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Him and his worth and our great need of him</p>
<p>You have right well conceited. Let us go,</p>
<p>For it is after midnight, and ere day</p>
<p>We will awake him and be sure of him. Exeunt.</p>

<h3>ACT II. SCENE I.</h3>
<p>Enter Brutus in his orchard.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. What, Lucius, ho!</p>
<p>I cannot, by the progress of the stars,</p>
<p>Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!</p>
<p>I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.</p>
<p>When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!</p>
<p>Enter Lucius.</p>
<p>LUCIUS. Call'd you, my lord?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.</p>
<p>When it is lighted, come and call me here.</p>
<p>LUCIUS. I will, my lord. Exit.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,</p>
<p>I know no personal cause to spurn at him,</p>
<p>But for the general. He would be crown'd:</p>
<p>How that might change his nature, there's the question.</p>
<p>It is the bright day that brings forth the adder</p>
<p>And that craves wary walking. Crown him that,</p>
<p>And then, I grant, we put a sting in him</p>
<p>That at his will he may do danger with.</p>
<p>The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins</p>
<p>Remorse from power, and, to speak truth of Caesar,</p>
<p>I have not known when his affections sway'd</p>
<p>More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof</p>
<p>That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,</p>
<p>Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;</p>
<p>But when he once attains the upmost round,</p>
<p>He then unto the ladder turns his back,</p>
<p>Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees</p>
<p>By which he did ascend. So Caesar may;</p>
<p>Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel</p>
<p>Will bear no color for the thing he is,</p>
<p>Fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,</p>
<p>Would run to these and these extremities;</p>
<p>And therefore think him as a serpent's egg</p>
<p>Which hatch'd would as his kind grow mischievous,</p>
<p>And kill him in the shell.</p>
<p>Re-enter Lucius.</p>
<p>LUCIUS. The taper burneth in your closet, sir.</p>
<p>Searching the window for a flint I found</p>
<p>This paper thus seal'd up, and I am sure</p>
<p>It did not lie there when I went to bed.</p>
<p>Gives him the letter.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Get you to bed again, it is not day.</p>
<p>Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?</p>
<p>LUCIUS. I know not, sir.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Look in the calendar and bring me word.</p>
<p>LUCIUS. I will, sir. Exit.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air</p>
<p>Give so much light that I may read by them.</p>
<p>Opens the letter and reads.</p>
<p>"Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake and see thyself!</p>
<p>Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!"</p>
<p>"Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!"</p>
<p>Such instigations have been often dropp'd</p>
<p>Where I have took them up.</p>
<p>"Shall Rome, etc." Thus must I piece it out.</p>
<p>Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?</p>
<p>My ancestors did from the streets of Rome</p>
<p>The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.</p>
<p>"Speak, strike, redress!" Am I entreated</p>
<p>To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,</p>
<p>If the redress will follow, thou receivest</p>
<p>Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!</p>
<p>Re-enter Lucius.</p>
<p>LUCIUS. Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.</p>
<p>Knocking within.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. 'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.</p>
<p>Exit Lucius.</p>
<p>Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar</p>
<p>I have not slept.</p>
<p>Between the acting of a dreadful thing</p>
<p>And the first motion, all the interim is</p>
<p>Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;</p>
<p>The genius and the mortal instruments</p>
<p>Are then in council, and the state of man,</p>
<p>Like to a little kingdom, suffers then</p>
<p>The nature of an insurrection.</p>
<p>Re-enter Lucius.</p>
<p>LUCIUS. Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,</p>
<p>Who doth desire to see you.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Is he alone?</p>
<p>LUCIUS. No, sir, there are more with him.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Do you know them?</p>
<p>LUCIUS. No, sir, their hats are pluck'd about their ears,</p>
<p>And half their faces buried in their cloaks,</p>
<p>That by no means I may discover them</p>
<p>By any mark of favor.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Let 'em enter. Exit Lucius.</p>
<p>They are the faction. O Conspiracy,</p>
<p>Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,</p>
<p>When evils are most free? O, then, by day</p>
<p>Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough</p>
<p>To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, Conspiracy;</p>
<p>Hide it in smiles and affability;</p>
<p>For if thou path, thy native semblance on,</p>
<p>Not Erebus itself were dim enough</p>
<p>To hide thee from prevention.</p>
<p>Enter the conspirators, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna,</p>
<p>Metellus Cimber, and Trebonius.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. I think we are too bold upon your rest.</p>
<p>Good morrow, Brutus, do we trouble you?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. I have been up this hour, awake all night.</p>
<p>Know I these men that come along with you?</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Yes, every man of them, and no man here</p>
<p>But honors you, and every one doth wish</p>
<p>You had but that opinion of yourself</p>
<p>Which every noble Roman bears of you.</p>
<p>This is Trebonius.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. He is welcome hither.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. This, Decius Brutus.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. He is welcome too.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. They are all welcome.</p>
<p>What watchful cares do interpose themselves</p>
<p>Betwixt your eyes and night?</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Shall I entreat a word? They whisper.</p>
<p>DECIUS. Here lies the east. Doth not the day break here?</p>
<p>CASCA. No.</p>
<p>CINNA. O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yongrey lines</p>
<p>That fret the clouds are messengers of day.</p>
<p>CASCA. You shall confess that you are both deceived.</p>
<p>Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,</p>
<p>Which is a great way growing on the south,</p>
<p>Weighing the youthful season of the year.</p>
<p>Some two months hence up higher toward the north</p>
<p>He first presents his fire, and the high east</p>
<p>Stands as the Capitol, directly here.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Give me your hands all over, one by one.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. And let us swear our resolution.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. No, not an oath. If not the face of men,</p>
<p>The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse-</p>
<p>If these be motives weak, break off betimes,</p>
<p>And every man hence to his idle bed;</p>
<p>So let high-sighted tyranny range on</p>
<p>Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,</p>
<p>As I am sure they do, bear fire enough</p>
<p>To kindle cowards and to steel with valor</p>
<p>The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,</p>
<p>What need we any spur but our own cause</p>
<p>To prick us to redress? What other bond</p>
<p>Than secret Romans that have spoke the word</p>
<p>And will not palter? And what other oath</p>
<p>Than honesty to honesty engaged</p>
<p>That this shall be or we will fall for it?</p>
<p>Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,</p>
<p>Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls</p>
<p>That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear</p>
<p>Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain</p>
<p>The even virtue of our enterprise,</p>
<p>Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,</p>
<p>To think that or our cause or our performance</p>
<p>Did need an oath; when every drop of blood</p>
<p>That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,</p>
<p>Is guilty of a several bastardy</p>
<p>If he do break the smallest particle</p>
<p>Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?</p>
<p>I think he will stand very strong with us.</p>
<p>CASCA. Let us not leave him out.</p>
<p>CINNA. No, by no means.</p>
<p>METELLUS. O, let us have him, for his silver hairs</p>
<p>Will purchase us a good opinion,</p>
<p>And buy men's voices to commend our deeds.</p>
<p>It shall be said his judgement ruled our hands;</p>
<p>Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,</p>
<p>But all be buried in his gravity.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. O, name him not; let us not break with him,</p>
<p>For he will never follow anything</p>
<p>That other men begin.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Then leave him out.</p>
<p>CASCA. Indeed he is not fit.</p>
<p>DECIUS. Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet</p>
<p>Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,</p>
<p>Should outlive Caesar. We shall find of him</p>
<p>A shrewd contriver; and you know his means,</p>
<p>If he improve them, may well stretch so far</p>
<p>As to annoy us all, which to prevent,</p>
<p>Let Antony and Caesar fall together.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,</p>
<p>To cut the head off and then hack the limbs</p>
<p>Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;</p>
<p>For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.</p>
<p>Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.</p>
<p>We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,</p>
<p>And in the spirit of men there is no blood.</p>
<p>O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,</p>
<p>And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,</p>
<p>Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,</p>
<p>Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;</p>
<p>Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,</p>
<p>Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds;</p>
<p>And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,</p>
<p>Stir up their servants to an act of rage</p>
<p>And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make</p>
<p>Our purpose necessary and not envious,</p>
<p>Which so appearing to the common eyes,</p>
<p>We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.</p>
<p>And for Mark Antony, think not of him,</p>
<p>For he can do no more than Caesar's arm</p>
<p>When Caesar's head is off.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Yet I fear him,</p>
<p>For in the ingrated love he bears to Caesar-</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.</p>
<p>If he love Caesar, all that he can do</p>
<p>Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar.</p>
<p>And that were much he should, for he is given</p>
<p>To sports, to wildness, and much company.</p>
<p>TREBONIUS. There is no fear in him-let him not die,</p>
<p>For he will live and laugh at this hereafter.</p>
<p>Clock strikes.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Peace, count the clock.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. The clock hath stricken three.</p>
<p>TREBONIUS. 'Tis time to part.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. But it is doubtful yet</p>
<p>Whether Caesar will come forth today or no,</p>
<p>For he is superstitious grown of late,</p>
<p>Quite from the main opinion he held once</p>
<p>Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.</p>
<p>It may be these apparent prodigies,</p>
<p>The unaccustom'd terror of this night,</p>
<p>And the persuasion of his augurers</p>
<p>May hold him from the Capitol today.</p>
<p>DECIUS. Never fear that. If he be so resolved,</p>
<p>I can o'ersway him, for he loves to hear</p>
<p>That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,</p>
<p>And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,</p>
<p>Lions with toils, and men with flatterers;</p>
<p>But when I tell him he hates flatterers,</p>
<p>He says he does, being then most flattered.</p>
<p>Let me work;</p>
<p>For I can give his humor the true bent,</p>
<p>And I will bring him to the Capitol.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. By the eighth hour. Is that the utter most?</p>
<p>CINNA. Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.</p>
<p>METELLUS. Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,</p>
<p>Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey.</p>
<p>I wonder none of you have thought of him.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Now, good Metellus, go along by him.</p>
<p>He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;</p>
<p>Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. The morning comes upon 's. We'll leave you, Brutus,</p>
<p>And, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember</p>
<p>What you have said and show yourselves true Romans.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;</p>
<p>Let not our looks put on our purposes,</p>
<p>But bear it as our Roman actors do,</p>
<p>With untired spirits and formal constancy.</p>
<p>And so, good morrow to you every one.</p>
<p>Exeunt all but Brutus.</p>
<p>Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter.</p>
<p>Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber;</p>
<p>Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,</p>
<p>Which busy care draws in the brains of men;</p>
<p>Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.</p>
<p>Enter Portia.</p>
<p>PORTIA. Brutus, my lord!</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Portia, what mean you? Wherefore rise you now?</p>
<p>It is not for your health thus to commit</p>
<p>Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.</p>
<p>PORTIA. Nor for yours neither. have ungently, Brutus,</p>
<p>Stole from my bed; and yesternight at supper</p>
<p>You suddenly arose and walk'd about,</p>
<p>Musing and sighing, with your arms across;</p>
<p>And when I ask'd you what the matter was,</p>
<p>You stared upon me with ungentle looks.</p>
<p>I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,</p>
<p>And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot.</p>
<p>Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,</p>
<p>But with an angry waiter of your hand</p>
<p>Gave sign for me to leave you. So I did,</p>
<p>Fearing to strengthen that impatience</p>
<p>Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal</p>
<p>Hoping it was but an effect of humor,</p>
<p>Which sometime hath his hour with every man.</p>
<p>It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,</p>
<p>And, could it work so much upon your shape</p>
<p>As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,</p>
<p>I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,</p>
<p>Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. I am not well in health, and that is all.</p>
<p>PORTIA. Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,</p>
<p>He would embrace the means to come by it.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.</p>
<p>PORTIA. Is Brutus sick, and is it physical</p>
<p>To walk unbraced and suck up the humors</p>
<p>Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,</p>
<p>And will he steal out of his wholesome bed</p>
<p>To dare the vile contagion of the night</p>
<p>And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air</p>
<p>To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus,</p>
<p>You have some sick offense within your mind,</p>
<p>Which by the right and virtue of my place</p>
<p>I ought to know of; and, upon my knees,</p>
<p>I charm you, by my once commended beauty,</p>
<p>By all your vows of love and that great vow</p>
<p>Which did incorporate and make us one,</p>
<p>That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,</p>
<p>Why you are heavy and what men tonight</p>
<p>Have had resort to you; for here have been</p>
<p>Some six or seven, who did hide their faces</p>
<p>Even from darkness.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Kneel not, gentle Portia.</p>
<p>PORTIA. I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.</p>
<p>Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,</p>
<p>Is it excepted I should know no secrets</p>
<p>That appertain to you? Am I yourself</p>
<p>But, as it were, in sort or limitation,</p>
<p>To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,</p>
<p>And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs</p>
<p>Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,</p>
<p>Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. You are my true and honorable wife,</p>
<p>As dear to me as are the ruddy drops</p>
<p>That visit my sad heart.</p>
<p>PORTIA. If this were true, then should I know this secret.</p>
<p>I grant I am a woman, but withal</p>
<p>A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.</p>
<p>I grant I am a woman, but withal</p>
<p>A woman well reputed, Cato's daughter.</p>
<p>Think you I am no stronger than my sex,</p>
<p>Being so father'd and so husbanded?</p>
<p>Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em.</p>
<p>I have made strong proof of my constancy,</p>
<p>Giving myself a voluntary wound</p>
<p>Here in the thigh. Can I bear that with patience</p>
<p>And not my husband's secrets?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. O ye gods,</p>
<p>Render me worthy of this noble wife! Knocking within.</p>
<p>Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,</p>
<p>And by and by thy bosom shall partake</p>
<p>The secrets of my heart.</p>
<p>All my engagements I will construe to thee,</p>
<p>All the charactery of my sad brows.</p>
<p>Leave me with haste. [Exit Portia.] Lucius, who's that</p>
<p>knocks?</p>
<p>Re-enter Lucius with Ligarius.</p>
<p>LUCIUS. Here is a sick man that would speak with you.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.</p>
<p>Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius, how?</p>
<p>LIGARIUS. Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,</p>
<p>To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!</p>
<p>LIGARIUS. I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand</p>
<p>Any exploit worthy the name of honor.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,</p>
<p>Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.</p>
<p>LIGARIUS. By all the gods that Romans bow before,</p>
<p>I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!</p>
<p>Brave son, derived from honorable loins!</p>
<p>Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up</p>
<p>My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,</p>
<p>And I will strive with things impossible,</p>
<p>Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. A piece of work that will make sick men whole.</p>
<p>LIGARIUS. But are not some whole that we must make sick?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. That must we also. What it is, my Caius,</p>
<p>I shall unfold to thee, as we are going</p>
<p>To whom it must be done.</p>
<p>LIGARIUS. Set on your foot,</p>
<p>And with a heart new-fired I follow you,</p>
<p>To do I know not what; but it sufficeth</p>
<p>That Brutus leads me on.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Follow me then. Exeunt.</p>
<h3>SCENE II. Caesar's house. Thunder and lightning.</h3>
<p>Enter Caesar, in his nightgown.</p>
<p>CAESAR. Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.</p>
<p>Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,</p>
<p>"Help, ho! They murther Caesar!" Who's within?</p>
<p>Enter a Servant.</p>
<p>SERVANT. My lord?</p>
<p>CAESAR. Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,</p>
<p>And bring me their opinions of success.</p>
<p>SERVANT. I will, my lord. Exit.</p>
<p>Enter Calpurnia.</p>
<p>CALPURNIA. What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth?</p>
<p>You shall not stir out of your house today.</p>
<p>CAESAR. Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me</p>
<p>Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see</p>
<p>The face of Caesar, they are vanished.</p>
<p>CALPURNIA. Caesar, I I stood on ceremonies,</p>
<p>Yet now they fright me. There is one within,</p>
<p>Besides the things that we have heard and seen,</p>
<p>Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.</p>
<p>A lioness hath whelped in the streets;</p>
<p>And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;</p>
<p>Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds,</p>
<p>In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,</p>
<p>Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;</p>
<p>The noise of battle hurtled in the air,</p>
<p>Horses did neigh and dying men did groan,</p>
<p>And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.</p>
<p>O Caesar! These things are beyond all use,</p>
<p>And I do fear them.</p>
<p>CAESAR. What can be avoided</p>
<p>Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?</p>
<p>Yet Caesar shall go forth, for these predictions</p>
<p>Are to the world in general as to Caesar.</p>
<p>CALPURNIA. When beggars die, there are no comets seen;</p>
<p>The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.</p>
<p>CAESAR. Cowards die many times before their deaths;</p>
<p>The valiant never taste of death but once.</p>
<p>Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,</p>
<p>It seems to me most strange that men should fear</p>
<p>Seeing that death, a necessary end,</p>
<p>Will come when it will come.</p>
<p>Re-enter Servant.</p>
<p>What say the augurers?</p>
<p>SERVANT. They would not have you to stir forth today.</p>
<p>Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,</p>
<p>They could not find a heart within the beast.</p>
<p>CAESAR. The gods do this in shame of cowardice.</p>
<p>Caesar should be a beast without a heart</p>
<p>If he should stay at home today for fear.</p>
<p>No, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full well</p>
<p>That Caesar is more dangerous than he.</p>
<p>We are two lions litter'd in one day,</p>
<p>And I the elder and more terrible.</p>
<p>And Caesar shall go forth.</p>
<p>CALPURNIA. Alas, my lord,</p>
<p>Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.</p>
<p>Do not go forth today. Call it my fear</p>
<p>That keeps you in the house and not your own.</p>
<p>We'll send Mark Antony to the Senate House,</p>
<p>And he shall say you are not well today.</p>
<p>Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.</p>
<p>CAESAR. Mark Antony shall say I am not well,</p>
<p>And, for thy humor, I will stay at home.</p>
<p>Enter Decius.</p>
<p>Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.</p>
<p>DECIUS. Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar!</p>
<p>I come to fetch you to the Senate House.</p>
<p>CAESAR. And you are come in very happy time</p>
<p>To bear my greeting to the senators</p>
<p>And tell them that I will not come today.</p>
<p>Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:</p>
<p>I will not come today. Tell them so, Decius.</p>
<p>CALPURNIA. Say he is sick.</p>
<p>CAESAR. Shall Caesar send a lie?</p>
<p>Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far</p>
<p>To be afeard to tell greybeards the truth?</p>
<p>Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.</p>
<p>DECIUS. Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,</p>
<p>Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.</p>
<p>CAESAR. The cause is in my will: I will not come,</p>
<p>That is enough to satisfy the Senate.</p>
<p>But, for your private satisfaction,</p>
<p>Because I love you, I will let you know.</p>
<p>Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home;</p>
<p>She dreamt tonight she saw my statue,</p>
<p>Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,</p>
<p>Did run pure blood, and many lusty Romans</p>
<p>Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it.</p>
<p>And these does she apply for warnings and portents</p>
<p>And evils imminent, and on her knee</p>
<p>Hath begg'd that I will stay at home today.</p>
<p>DECIUS. This dream is all amiss interpreted;</p>
<p>It was a vision fair and fortunate.</p>
<p>Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,</p>
<p>In which so many smiling Romans bathed,</p>
<p>Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck</p>
<p>Reviving blood, and that great men shall press</p>
<p>For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.</p>
<p>This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.</p>
<p>CAESAR. And this way have you well expounded it.</p>
<p>DECIUS. I have, when you have heard what I can say.</p>
<p>And know it now, the Senate have concluded</p>
<p>To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.</p>
<p>If you shall send them word you will not come,</p>
<p>Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock</p>
<p>Apt to be render'd, for someone to say</p>
<p>"Break up the Senate till another time,</p>
<p>When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams."</p>
<p>If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper</p>
<p>"Lo, Caesar is afraid"?</p>
<p>Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love</p>
<p>To your proceeding bids me tell you this,</p>
<p>And reason to my love is liable.</p>
<p>CAESAR. How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!</p>
<p>I am ashamed I did yield to them.</p>
<p>Give me my robe, for I will go.</p>
<p>Enter Publius, Brutus, Ligarius, Metellus, Casca,</p>
<p>Trebonius, and Cinna.</p>
<p>And look where Publius is come to fetch me.</p>
<p>PUBLIUS. Good morrow,Caesar.</p>
<p>CAESAR. Welcome, Publius.</p>
<p>What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?</p>
<p>Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,</p>
<p>Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy</p>
<p>As that same ague which hath made you lean.</p>
<p>What is't o'clock?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.</p>
<p>CAESAR. I thank you for your pains and courtesy.</p>
<p>Enter Antony.</p>
<p>See, Antony, that revels long o' nights,</p>
<p>Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.</p>
<p>ANTONY. So to most noble Caesar.</p>
<p>CAESAR. Bid them prepare within.</p>
<p>I am to blame to be thus waited for.</p>
<p>Now, Cinna; now, Metellus; what, Trebonius,</p>
<p>I have an hour's talk in store for you;</p>
<p>Remember that you call on me today;</p>
<p>Be near me, that I may remember you.</p>
<p>TREBONIUS. Caesar, I will. [Aside.] And so near will I be</p>
<p>That your best friends shall wish I had been further.</p>
<p>CAESAR. Good friends, go in and taste some wine with me,</p>
<p>And we like friends will straightway go together.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. [Aside.] That every like is not the same, O Caesar,</p>
<p>The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon! Exeunt.</p>
<h3>SCENE III. A street near the Capitol.</h3>
<p>Enter Artemidorus, reading paper.</p>
<p>ARTEMIDORUS. "Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius;</p>
<p>come</p>
<p>not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna; trust not Trebonius;</p>
<p>mark</p>
<p>well Metellus Cimber; Decius Brutus loves thee not; thou hast</p>
<p>wronged Caius Ligarius. There is but one mind in all these</p>
<p>men,</p>
<p>and it is bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal,</p>
<p>look</p>
<p>about you. Security gives way to conspiracy. The mighty gods</p>
<p>defend thee!</p>
<p>Thy lover, Artemidorus."</p>
<p>Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,</p>
<p>And as a suitor will I give him this.</p>
<p>My heart laments that virtue cannot live</p>
<p>Out of the teeth of emulation.</p>
<p>If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayest live;</p>
<p>If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive. Exit.</p>
<h3>SCENE IV. Another part of the same street, before the house of Brutus.</h3>
<p>Enter Portia and Lucius.</p>
<p>PORTIA. I prithee, boy, run to the Senate House;</p>
<p>Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.</p>
<p>Why dost thou stay?</p>
<p>LUCIUS. To know my errand, madam.</p>
<p>PORTIA. I would have had thee there, and here again,</p>
<p>Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.</p>
<p>O constancy, be strong upon my side!</p>
<p>Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!</p>
<p>I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.</p>
<p>How hard it is for women to keep counsel!</p>
<p>Art thou here yet?</p>
<p>LUCIUS. Madam, what should I do?</p>
<p>Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?</p>
<p>And so return to you, and nothing else?</p>
<p>PORTIA. Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,</p>
<p>For he went sickly forth; and take good note</p>
<p>What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.</p>
<p>Hark, boy, what noise is that?</p>
<p>LUCIUS. I hear none, madam.</p>
<p>PORTIA. Prithee, listen well.</p>
<p>I heard a bustling rumor like a fray,</p>
<p>And the wind brings it from the Capitol.</p>
<p>LUCIUS. Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.</p>
<p>Enter the Soothsayer.</p>
<p>PORTIA. Come hither, fellow;</p>
<p>Which way hast thou been?</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER. At mine own house, good lady.</p>
<p>PORTIA. What is't o'clock?</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER. About the ninth hour, lady.</p>
<p>PORTIA. Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER. Madam, not yet. I go to take my stand</p>
<p>To see him pass on to the Capitol.</p>
<p>PORTIA. Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER. That I have, lady. If it will please Caesar</p>
<p>To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,</p>
<p>I shall beseech him to befriend himself.</p>
<p>PORTIA. Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER. None that I know will be, much that I fear may</p>
<p>chance.</p>
<p>Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow,</p>
<p>The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,</p>
<p>Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,</p>
<p>Will crowd a feeble man almost to death.</p>
<p>I'll get me to a place more void and there</p>
<p>Speak to great Caesar as he comes along. Exit.</p>
<p>PORTIA. I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing</p>
<p>The heart of woman is! O Brutus,</p>
<p>The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!</p>
<p>Sure, the boy heard me. Brutus hath a suit</p>
<p>That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.</p>
<p>Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;</p>
<p>Say I am merry. Come to me again,</p>
<p>And bring me word what he doth say to thee.</p>
<p>Exeunt severally.</p>

<h3>ACT III. SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting above. A crowd of people, among them Artemidorus and the Soothsayer.</h3>
<p>Flourish. Enter Caesar, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Metellus,</p>
<p>Trebonius, Cinna, Antony, Lepidus, Popilius, Publius, and others.</p>
<p>CAESAR. The ides of March are come.</p>
<p>SOOTHSAYER. Ay, Caesar, but not gone.</p>
<p>A Hail, Caesar! Read this schedule.</p>
<p>DECIUS. Trebonius doth desire you to o'er read,</p>
<p>At your best leisure, this his humble suit.</p>
<p>ARTEMIDORUS. O Caesar, read mine first, for mine's a suit</p>
<p>That touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar.</p>
<p>CAESAR. What touches us ourself shall be last served.</p>
<p>ARTEMIDORUS. Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.</p>
<p>CAESAR. What, is the fellow mad?</p>
<p>PUBLIUS. Sirrah, give place.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. What, urge you your petitions in the street?</p>
<p>Come to the Capitol.</p>
<p>Caesar goes up to the Senate House, the rest follow.</p>
<p>POPILIUS. I wish your enterprise today may thrive.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. What enterprise, Popilius?</p>
<p>POPILIUS. Fare you well.</p>
<p>Advances to Caesar.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. What said Popilius Lena?</p>
<p>CASSIUS. He wish'd today our enterprise might thrive.</p>
<p>I fear our purpose is discovered.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Look, how he makes to Caesar. Mark him.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Casca,</p>
<p>Be sudden, for we fear prevention.</p>
<p>Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,</p>
<p>Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,</p>
<p>For I will slay myself.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Cassius, be constant.</p>
<p>Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;</p>
<p>For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Trebonius knows his time, for, look you, Brutus,</p>
<p>He draws Mark Antony out of the way.</p>
<p>Exeunt Antony and Trebonius.</p>
<p>DECIUS. Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him</p>
<p>And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. He is address'd; press near and second him.</p>
<p>CINNA. Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.</p>
<p>CAESAR. Are we all ready? What is now amiss</p>
<p>That Caesar and his Senate must redress?</p>
<p>METELLUS. Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,</p>
<p>Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat</p>
<p>An humble heart. Kneels.</p>
<p>CAESAR. I must prevent thee, Cimber.</p>
<p>These couchings and these lowly courtesies</p>
<p>Might fire the blood of ordinary men</p>
<p>And turn preordinance and first decree</p>
<p>Into the law of children. Be not fond</p>
<p>To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood</p>
<p>That will be thaw'd from the true quality</p>
<p>With that which melteth fools- I mean sweet words,</p>
<p>Low-crooked court'sies, and base spaniel-fawning.</p>
<p>Thy brother by decree is banished.</p>
<p>If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,</p>
<p>I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.</p>
<p>Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause</p>
<p>Will he be satisfied.</p>
<p>METELLUS. Is there no voice more worthy than my own,</p>
<p>To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear</p>
<p>For the repealing of my banish'd brother?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar,</p>
<p>Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may</p>
<p>Have an immediate freedom of repeal.</p>
<p>CAESAR. What, Brutus?</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Pardon, Caesar! Caesar, pardon!</p>
<p>As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall</p>
<p>To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.</p>
<p>CAESAR. I could be well moved, if I were as you;</p>
<p>If I could pray to move, prayers would move me;</p>
<p>But I am constant as the northern star,</p>
<p>Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality</p>
<p>There is no fellow in the firmament.</p>
<p>The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks;</p>
<p>They are all fire and every one doth shine;</p>
<p>But there's but one in all doth hold his place.</p>
<p>So in the world, 'tis furnish'd well with men,</p>
<p>And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;</p>
<p>Yet in the number I do know but one</p>
<p>That unassailable holds on his rank,</p>
<p>Unshaked of motion; and that I am he,</p>
<p>Let me a little show it, even in this;</p>
<p>That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,</p>
<p>And constant do remain to keep him so.</p>
<p>CINNA. O Caesar-</p>
<p>CAESAR. Hence! Wilt thou lift up Olympus?</p>
<p>DECIUS. Great Caesar-</p>
<p>CAESAR. Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?</p>
<p>CASCA. Speak, hands, for me!</p>
<p>Casca first, then the other Conspirators</p>
<p>and Marcus Brutus stab Caesar.</p>
<p>CAESAR. Et tu, Brute?- Then fall, Caesar! Dies.</p>
<p>CINNA. Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!</p>
<p>Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Some to the common pulpits and cry out</p>
<p>"Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!"</p>
<p>BRUTUS. People and senators, be not affrighted,</p>
<p>Fly not, stand still; ambition's debt is paid.</p>
<p>CASCA. Go to the pulpit, Brutus.</p>
<p>DECIUS. And Cassius too.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Where's Publius?</p>
<p>CINNA. Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.</p>
<p>METELLUS. Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's</p>
<p>Should chance-</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer,</p>
<p>There is no harm intended to your person,</p>
<p>Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. And leave us, Publius, lest that the people</p>
<p>Rushing on us should do your age some mischief.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Do so, and let no man abide this deed</p>
<p>But we the doers.</p>
<p>Re-enter Trebonius.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Where is Antony?</p>
<p>TREBONIUS. Fled to his house amazed.</p>
<p>Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run</p>
<p>As it were doomsday.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Fates, we will know your pleasures.</p>
<p>That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time</p>
<p>And drawing days out that men stand upon.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life</p>
<p>Cuts off so many years of fearing death.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Grant that, and then is death a benefit;</p>
<p>So are we Caesar's friends that have abridged</p>
<p>His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,</p>
<p>And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood</p>
<p>Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords;</p>
<p>Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace,</p>
<p>And waving our red weapons o'er our heads,</p>
<p>Let's all cry, "Peace, freedom, and liberty!"</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence</p>
<p>Shall this our lofty scene be acted over</p>
<p>In states unborn and accents yet unknown!</p>
<p>BRUTUS. How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,</p>
<p>That now on Pompey's basis lies along</p>
<p>No worthier than the dust!</p>
<p>CASSIUS. So oft as that shall be,</p>
<p>So often shall the knot of us be call'd</p>
<p>The men that gave their country liberty.</p>
<p>DECIUS. What, shall we forth?</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Ay, every man away.</p>
<p>Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels</p>
<p>With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.</p>
<p>Enter a Servant.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony's.</p>
<p>SERVANT. Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel,</p>
<p>Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down,</p>
<p>And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:</p>
<p>Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;</p>
<p>Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving.</p>
<p>Say I love Brutus and I honor him;</p>
<p>Say I fear'd Caesar, honor'd him, and loved him.</p>
<p>If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony</p>
<p>May safely come to him and be resolved</p>
<p>How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,</p>
<p>Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead</p>
<p>So well as Brutus living, but will follow</p>
<p>The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus</p>
<p>Thorough the hazards of this untrod state</p>
<p>With all true faith. So says my master Antony.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;</p>
<p>I never thought him worse.</p>
<p>Tell him, so please him come unto this place,</p>
<p>He shall be satisfied and, by my honor,</p>
<p>Depart untouch'd.</p>
<p>SERVANT. I'll fetch him presently. Exit.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. I know that we shall have him well to friend.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. I wish we may, but yet have I a mind</p>
<p>That fears him much, and my misgiving still</p>
<p>Falls shrewdly to the purpose.</p>
<p>Re-enter Antony.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. But here comes Antony. Welcome, Mark Antony.</p>
<p>ANTONY. O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?</p>
<p>Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,</p>
<p>Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.</p>
<p>I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,</p>
<p>Who else must be let blood, who else is rank.</p>
<p>If I myself, there is no hour so fit</p>
<p>As Caesar's death's hour, nor no instrument</p>
<p>Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich</p>
<p>With the most noble blood of all this world.</p>
<p>I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,</p>
<p>Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,</p>
<p>Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years,</p>
<p>I shall not find myself so apt to die;</p>
<p>No place will please me so, no means of death,</p>
<p>As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,</p>
<p>The choice and master spirits of this age.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. O Antony, beg not your death of us!</p>
<p>Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,</p>
<p>As, by our hands and this our present act</p>
<p>You see we do, yet see you but our hands</p>
<p>And this the bleeding business they have done.</p>
<p>Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;</p>
<p>And pity to the general wrong of Rome-</p>
<p>As fire drives out fire, so pity pity-</p>
<p>Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,</p>
<p>To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony;</p>
<p>Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts</p>
<p>Of brothers' temper, do receive you in</p>
<p>With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Your voice shall be as strong as any man's</p>
<p>In the disposing of new dignities.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Only be patient till we have appeased</p>
<p>The multitude, beside themselves with fear,</p>
<p>And then we will deliver you the cause</p>
<p>Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,</p>
<p>Have thus proceeded.</p>
<p>ANTONY. I doubt not of your wisdom.</p>
<p>Let each man render me his bloody hand.</p>
<p>First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;</p>
<p>Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;</p>
<p>Now, Decius Brutus, yours; now yours, Metellus;</p>
<p>Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;</p>
<p>Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.</p>
<p>Gentlemen all- alas, what shall I say?</p>
<p>My credit now stands on such slippery ground,</p>
<p>That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,</p>
<p>Either a coward or a flatterer.</p>
<p>That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true!</p>
<p>If then thy spirit look upon us now,</p>
<p>Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death</p>
<p>To see thy Antony making his peace,</p>
<p>Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,</p>
<p>Most noble! In the presence of thy corse?</p>
<p>Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,</p>
<p>Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,</p>
<p>It would become me better than to close</p>
<p>In terms of friendship with thine enemies.</p>
<p>Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart,</p>
<p>Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand,</p>
<p>Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy Lethe.</p>
<p>O world, thou wast the forest to this hart,</p>
<p>And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.</p>
<p>How like a deer strucken by many princes</p>
<p>Dost thou here lie!</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Mark Antony-</p>
<p>ANTONY. Pardon me, Caius Cassius.</p>
<p>The enemies of Caesar shall say this:</p>
<p>Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. I blame you not for praising Caesar so;</p>
<p>But what compact mean you to have with us?</p>
<p>Will you be prick'd in number of our friends,</p>
<p>Or shall we on, and not depend on you?</p>
<p>ANTONY. Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed</p>
<p>Sway'd from the point by looking down on Caesar.</p>
<p>Friends am I with you all and love you all,</p>
<p>Upon this hope that you shall give me reasons</p>
<p>Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Or else were this a savage spectacle.</p>
<p>Our reasons are so full of good regard</p>
<p>That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,</p>
<p>You should be satisfied.</p>
<p>ANTONY. That's all I seek;</p>
<p>And am moreover suitor that I may</p>
<p>Produce his body to the marketplace,</p>
<p>And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,</p>
<p>Speak in the order of his funeral.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. You shall, Mark Antony.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Brutus, a word with you.</p>
<p>[Aside to Brutus.] You know not what you do. Do not consent</p>
<p>That Antony speak in his funeral.</p>
<p>Know you how much the people may be moved</p>
<p>By that which he will utter?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. By your pardon,</p>
<p>I will myself into the pulpit first,</p>
<p>And show the reason of our Caesar's death.</p>
<p>What Antony shall speak, I will protest</p>
<p>He speaks by leave and by permission,</p>
<p>And that we are contented Caesar shall</p>
<p>Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.</p>
<p>It shall advantage more than do us wrong.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. I know not what may fall; I like it not.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.</p>
<p>You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,</p>
<p>But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,</p>
<p>And say you do't by our permission,</p>
<p>Else shall you not have any hand at all</p>
<p>About his funeral. And you shall speak</p>
<p>In the same pulpit whereto I am going,</p>
<p>After my speech is ended.</p>
<p>ANTONY. Be it so,</p>
<p>I do desire no more.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Prepare the body then, and follow us.</p>
<p>Exeunt all but Antony.</p>
<p>ANTONY. O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,</p>
<p>That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!</p>
<p>Thou art the ruins of the noblest man</p>
<p>That ever lived in the tide of times.</p>
<p>Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!</p>
<p>Over thy wounds now do I prophesy</p>
<p>(Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips</p>
<p>To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue)</p>
<p>A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;</p>
<p>Domestic fury and fierce civil strife</p>
<p>Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;</p>
<p>Blood and destruction shall be so in use,</p>
<p>And dreadful objects so familiar,</p>
<p>That mothers shall but smile when they behold</p>
<p>Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;</p>
<p>All pity choked with custom of fell deeds,</p>
<p>And Caesar's spirit ranging for revenge,</p>
<p>With Ate by his side come hot from hell,</p>
<p>Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice</p>
<p>Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war,</p>
<p>That this foul deed shall smell above the earth</p>
<p>With carrion men, groaning for burial.</p>
<p>Enter a Servant.</p>
<p>You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?</p>
<p>SERVANT. I do, Mark Antony.</p>
<p>ANTONY. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.</p>
<p>SERVANT. He did receive his letters, and is coming,</p>
<p>And bid me say to you by word of mouth-</p>
<p>O Caesar! Sees the body.</p>
<p>ANTONY. Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.</p>
<p>Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes,</p>
<p>Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,</p>
<p>Began to water. Is thy master coming?</p>
<p>SERVANT. He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.</p>
<p>ANTONY. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.</p>
<p>Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,</p>
<p>No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;</p>
<p>Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet stay awhile,</p>
<p>Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse</p>
<p>Into the marketplace. There shall I try,</p>
<p>In my oration, how the people take</p>
<p>The cruel issue of these bloody men,</p>
<p>According to the which thou shalt discourse</p>
<p>To young Octavius of the state of things.</p>
<p>Lend me your hand. Exeunt with Caesar's body.</p>
<h3>SCENE II. The Forum.</h3>
<p>Enter Brutus and Cassius, and a throng of Citizens.</p>
<p>CITIZENS. We will be satisfied! Let us be satisfied!</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Then follow me and give me audience, friends.</p>
<p>Cassius, go you into the other street</p>
<p>And part the numbers.</p>
<p>Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;</p>
<p>Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;</p>
<p>And public reasons shall be rendered</p>
<p>Of Caesar's death.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN. I will hear Brutus speak.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN. I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons,</p>
<p>When severally we hear them rendered.</p>
<p>Exit Cassius, with some Citizens.</p>
<p>Brutus goes into the pulpit.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN. The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence!</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Be patient till the last.</p>
<p>Romans, countrymen, and lovers! Hear me for my cause, and be</p>
<p>silent, that you may hear. Believe me for mine honor, and</p>
<p>have</p>
<p>respect to mine honor, that you may believe. Censure me in</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>wisdom, and awake your senses, that you may the better judge.</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar's,</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>him I say that Brutus' love to Caesar was no less than his.</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>my answer: Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved</p>
<p>Rome</p>
<p>more. Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves,</p>
<p>than</p>
<p>that Caesar were dead to live all freemen? As Caesar loved</p>
<p>me, I</p>
<p>weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was</p>
<p>valiant, I honor him; but as he was ambitious, I slew him.</p>
<p>There</p>
<p>is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his</p>
<p>valor,</p>
<p>and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I</p>
<p>offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country?</p>
<p>If</p>
<p>any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.</p>
<p>ALL. None, Brutus, none.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Then none have I offended. I have done no more to</p>
<p>Caesar</p>
<p>than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is</p>
<p>enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated, wherein he</p>
<p>was</p>
<p>worthy, nor his offenses enforced, for which he suffered</p>
<p>death.</p>
<p>Enter Antony and others, with Caesar's body.</p>
<p>Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he</p>
<p>had</p>
<p>no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying,</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>place in the commonwealth, as which of you shall not? With</p>
<p>this I</p>
<p>depart- that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I</p>
<p>have the same dagger for myself, when it shall please my</p>
<p>country</p>
<p>to need my death.</p>
<p>ALL. Live, Brutus, live, live!</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN. Bring him with triumph home unto his house.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN. Give him a statue with his ancestors.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN. Let him be Caesar.</p>
<p>FOURTH CITIZEN. Caesar's better parts</p>
<p>Shall be crown'd in Brutus.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN. We'll bring him to his house with shouts and</p>
<p>clamors.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. My countrymen-</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN. Peace! Silence! Brutus speaks.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN. Peace, ho!</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Good countrymen, let me depart alone,</p>
<p>And, for my sake, stay here with Antony.</p>
<p>Do grace to Caesar's corse, and grace his speech</p>
<p>Tending to Caesar's glories, which Mark Antony,</p>
<p>By our permission, is allow'd to make.</p>
<p>I do entreat you, not a man depart,</p>
<p>Save I alone, till Antony have spoke. Exit.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN. Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN. Let him go up into the public chair;</p>
<p>We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.</p>
<p>ANTONY. For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.</p>
<p>Goes into the pulpit.</p>
<p>FOURTH CITIZEN. What does he say of Brutus?</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN. He says, for Brutus' sake,</p>
<p>He finds himself beholding to us all.</p>
<p>FOURTH CITIZEN. 'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN. This Caesar was a tyrant.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN. Nay, that's certain.</p>
<p>We are blest that Rome is rid of him.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN. Peace! Let us hear what Antony can say.</p>
<p>ANTONY. You gentle Romans-</p>
<p>ALL. Peace, ho! Let us hear him.</p>
<p>ANTONY. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!</p>
<p>I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.</p>
<p>The evil that men do lives after them,</p>
<p>The good is oft interred with their bones;</p>
<p>So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus</p>
<p>Hath told you Caesar was ambitious;</p>
<p>If it were so, it was a grievous fault,</p>
<p>And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.</p>
<p>Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest-</p>
<p>For Brutus is an honorable man;</p>
<p>So are they all, all honorable men-</p>
<p>Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.</p>
<p>He was my friend, faithful and just to me;</p>
<p>But Brutus says he was ambitious,</p>
<p>And Brutus is an honorable man.</p>
<p>He hath brought many captives home to Rome,</p>
<p>Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill.</p>
<p>Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?</p>
<p>When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;</p>
<p>Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:</p>
<p>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,</p>
<p>And Brutus is an honorable man.</p>
<p>You all did see that on the Lupercal</p>
<p>I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</p>
<p>Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?</p>
<p>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,</p>
<p>And sure he is an honorable man.</p>
<p>I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,</p>
<p>But here I am to speak what I do know.</p>
<p>You all did love him once, not without cause;</p>
<p>What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?</p>
<p>O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,</p>
<p>And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;</p>
<p>My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,</p>
<p>And I must pause till it come back to me.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN. Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN. If thou consider rightly of the matter,</p>
<p>Caesar has had great wrong.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN. Has he, masters?</p>
<p>I fear there will a worse come in his place.</p>
<p>FOURTH CITIZEN. Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the</p>
<p>crown;</p>
<p>Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN. If it be found so, some will dear abide it.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN. Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with</p>
<p>weeping.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN. There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.</p>
<p>FOURTH CITIZEN. Now mark him, he begins again to speak.</p>
<p>ANTONY. But yesterday the word of Caesar might</p>
<p>Have stood against the world. Now lies he there,</p>
<p>And none so poor to do him reverence.</p>
<p>O masters! If I were disposed to stir</p>
<p>Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,</p>
<p>I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,</p>
<p>Who, you all know, are honorable men.</p>
<p>I will not do them wrong; I rather choose</p>
<p>To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,</p>
<p>Than I will wrong such honorable men.</p>
<p>But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;</p>
<p>I found it in his closet, 'tis his will.</p>
<p>Let but the commons hear this testament-</p>
<p>Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read-</p>
<p>And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds</p>
<p>And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,</p>
<p>Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,</p>
<p>And, dying, mention it within their wills,</p>
<p>Bequeathing it as a rich legacy</p>
<p>Unto their issue.</p>
<p>FOURTH CITIZEN. We'll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony.</p>
<p>ALL. The will, the will! We will hear Caesar's will.</p>
<p>ANTONY. Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;</p>
<p>It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.</p>
<p>You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;</p>
<p>And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,</p>
<p>It will inflame you, it will make you mad.</p>
<p>'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,</p>
<p>For if you should, O, what would come of it!</p>
<p>FOURTH CITIZEN. Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony.</p>
<p>You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.</p>
<p>ANTONY. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?</p>
<p>I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it.</p>
<p>I fear I wrong the honorable men</p>
<p>Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.</p>
<p>FOURTH CITIZEN. They were traitors. Honorable men!</p>
<p>ALL. The will! The testament!</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN. They were villains, murtherers. The will!</p>
<p>Read the will!</p>
<p>ANTONY. You will compel me then to read the will?</p>
<p>Then make a ring about the corse of Caesar,</p>
<p>And let me show you him that made the will.</p>
<p>Shall I descend? And will you give me leave?</p>
<p>ALL. Come down.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN. Descend.</p>
<p>He comes down from the pulpit.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN. You shall have leave.</p>
<p>FOURTH CITIZEN. A ring, stand round.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN. Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN. Room for Antony, most noble Antony.</p>
<p>ANTONY. Nay, press not so upon me, stand far off.</p>
<p>ALL. Stand back; room, bear back!</p>
<p>ANTONY. If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.</p>
<p>You all do know this mantle. I remember</p>
<p>The first time ever Caesar put it on;</p>
<p>'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,</p>
<p>That day he overcame the Nervii.</p>
<p>Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through;</p>
<p>See what a rent the envious Casca made;</p>
<p>Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;</p>
<p>And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,</p>
<p>Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,</p>
<p>As rushing out of doors, to be resolved</p>
<p>If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;</p>
<p>For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel.</p>
<p>Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!</p>
<p>This was the most unkindest cut of all;</p>
<p>For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,</p>
<p>Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,</p>
<p>Quite vanquish'd him. Then burst his mighty heart,</p>
<p>And, in his mantle muffling up his face,</p>
<p>Even at the base of Pompey's statue,</p>
<p>Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.</p>
<p>O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!</p>
<p>Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,</p>
<p>Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.</p>
<p>O, now you weep, and I perceive you feel</p>
<p>The dint of pity. These are gracious drops.</p>
<p>Kind souls, what weep you when you but behold</p>
<p>Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,</p>
<p>Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN. O piteous spectacle!</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN. O noble Caesar!</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN. O woeful day!</p>
<p>FOURTH CITIZEN. O traitors villains!</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN. O most bloody sight!</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN. We will be revenged.</p>
<p>ALL. Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill!</p>
<p>Slay! Let not a traitor live!</p>
<p>ANTONY. Stay, countrymen.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN. Peace there! Hear the noble Antony.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN. We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>ANTONY. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up</p>
<p>To such a sudden flood of mutiny.</p>
<p>They that have done this deed are honorable.</p>
<p>What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,</p>
<p>That made them do it. They are wise and honorable,</p>
<p>And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.</p>
<p>I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.</p>
<p>I am no orator, as Brutus is;</p>
<p>But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,</p>
<p>That love my friend, and that they know full well</p>
<p>That gave me public leave to speak of him.</p>
<p>For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,</p>
<p>Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,</p>
<p>To stir men's blood. I only speak right on;</p>
<p>I tell you that which you yourselves do know;</p>
<p>Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor dumb mouths,</p>
<p>And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,</p>
<p>And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony</p>
<p>Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue</p>
<p>In every wound of Caesar that should move</p>
<p>The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.</p>
<p>ALL. We'll mutiny.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN. We'll burn the house of Brutus.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN. Away, then! Come, seek the conspirators.</p>
<p>ANTONY. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.</p>
<p>ALL. Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony!</p>
<p>ANTONY. Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.</p>
<p>Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?</p>
<p>Alas, you know not; I must tell you then.</p>
<p>You have forgot the will I told you of.</p>
<p>ALL. Most true, the will! Let's stay and hear the will.</p>
<p>ANTONY. Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.</p>
<p>To every Roman citizen he gives,</p>
<p>To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN. Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN. O royal Caesar!</p>
<p>ANTONY. Hear me with patience.</p>
<p>ALL. Peace, ho!</p>
<p>ANTONY. Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,</p>
<p>His private arbors, and new-planted orchards,</p>
<p>On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,</p>
<p>And to your heirs forever- common pleasures,</p>
<p>To walk abroad and recreate yourselves.</p>
<p>Here was a Caesar! When comes such another?</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN. Never, never. Come, away, away!</p>
<p>We'll burn his body in the holy place</p>
<p>And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.</p>
<p>Take up the body.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN. Go fetch fire.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN. Pluck down benches.</p>
<p>FOURTH CITIZEN. Pluck down forms, windows, anything.</p>
<p>Exeunt Citizens with the body.</p>
<p>ANTONY. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,</p>
<p>Take thou what course thou wilt.</p>
<p>Enter a Servant.</p>
<p>How now, fellow?</p>
<p>SERVANT. Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.</p>
<p>ANTONY. Where is he?</p>
<p>SERVANT. He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.</p>
<p>ANTONY. And thither will I straight to visit him.</p>
<p>He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,</p>
<p>And in this mood will give us anything.</p>
<p>SERVANT. I heard him say Brutus and Cassius</p>
<p>Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.</p>
<p>ANTONY. Be like they had some notice of the people,</p>
<p>How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius. Exeunt.</p>
<h3>SCENE III. A street.</h3>
<p>Enter Cinna the poet.</p>
<p>CINNA. I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar,</p>
<p>And things unluckily charge my fantasy.</p>
<p>I have no will to wander forth of doors,</p>
<p>Yet something leads me forth.</p>
<p>Enter Citizens.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN. What is your name?</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN. Whither are you going?</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN. Where do you dwell?</p>
<p>FOURTH CITIZEN. Are you a married man or a bachelor?</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN. Answer every man directly.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN. Ay, and briefly.</p>
<p>FOURTH CITIZEN. Ay, and wisely.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN. Ay, and truly, you were best.</p>
<p>CINNA. What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I dwell?</p>
<p>Am I</p>
<p>a married man or a bachelor? Then, to answer every man</p>
<p>directly</p>
<p>and briefly, wisely and truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN. That's as much as to say they are fools that</p>
<p>marry.</p>
<p>You'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed directly.</p>
<p>CINNA. Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN. As a friend or an enemy?</p>
<p>CINNA. As a friend.</p>
<p>SECOND CITIZEN. That matter is answered directly.</p>
<p>FOURTH CITIZEN. For your dwelling, briefly.</p>
<p>CINNA. Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN. Your name, sir, truly.</p>
<p>CINNA. Truly, my name is Cinna.</p>
<p>FIRST CITIZEN. Tear him to pieces, he's a conspirator.</p>
<p>CINNA. I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.</p>
<p>FOURTH CITIZEN. Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his</p>
<p>bad</p>
<p>verses.</p>
<p>CINNA. I am not Cinna the conspirator.</p>
<p>FOURTH CITIZEN. It is no matter, his name's Cinna. Pluck but</p>
<p>his</p>
<p>name out of his heart, and turn him going.</p>
<p>THIRD CITIZEN. Tear him, tear him! Come, brands, ho,</p>
<p>firebrands. To</p>
<p>Brutus', to Cassius'; burn all. Some to Decius' house, and</p>
<p>some</p>
<p>to Casca's, some to Ligarius'. Away, go! Exeunt.</p>

<h3>ACT IV. SCENE I. A house in Rome. Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus, seated at a table.</h3>
<p>ANTONY. These many then shall die, their names are prick'd.</p>
<p>OCTAVIUS. Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?</p>
<p>LEPIDUS. I do consent-</p>
<p>OCTAVIUS. Prick him down, Antony.</p>
<p>LEPIDUS. Upon condition Publius shall not live,</p>
<p>Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.</p>
<p>ANTONY. He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.</p>
<p>But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house,</p>
<p>Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine</p>
<p>How to cut off some charge in legacies.</p>
<p>LEPIDUS. What, shall I find you here?</p>
<p>OCTAVIUS. Or here, or at the Capitol. Exit Lepidus.</p>
<p>ANTONY. This is a slight unmeritable man,</p>
<p>Meet to be sent on errands. Is it fit,</p>
<p>The three-fold world divided, he should stand</p>
<p>One of the three to share it?</p>
<p>OCTAVIUS. So you thought him,</p>
<p>And took his voice who should be prick'd to die</p>
<p>In our black sentence and proscription.</p>
<p>ANTONY. Octavius, I have seen more days than you,</p>
<p>And though we lay these honors on this man</p>
<p>To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,</p>
<p>He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,</p>
<p>To groan and sweat under the business,</p>
<p>Either led or driven, as we point the way;</p>
<p>And having brought our treasure where we will,</p>
<p>Then take we down his load and turn him off,</p>
<p>Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears</p>
<p>And graze in commons.</p>
<p>OCTAVIUS. You may do your will,</p>
<p>But he's a tried and valiant soldier.</p>
<p>ANTONY. So is my horse, Octavius, and for that</p>
<p>I do appoint him store of provender.</p>
<p>It is a creature that I teach to fight,</p>
<p>To wind, to stop, to run directly on,</p>
<p>His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.</p>
<p>And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so:</p>
<p>He must be taught, and train'd, and bid go forth;</p>
<p>A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds</p>
<p>On objects, arts, and imitations,</p>
<p>Which, out of use and staled by other men,</p>
<p>Begin his fashion. Do not talk of him</p>
<p>But as a property. And now, Octavius,</p>
<p>Listen great things. Brutus and Cassius</p>
<p>Are levying powers; we must straight make head;</p>
<p>Therefore let our alliance be combined,</p>
<p>Our best friends made, our means stretch'd;</p>
<p>And let us presently go sit in council,</p>
<p>How covert matters may be best disclosed,</p>
<p>And open perils surest answered.</p>
<p>OCTAVIUS. Let us do so, for we are at the stake,</p>
<p>And bay'd about with many enemies;</p>
<p>And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,</p>
<p>Millions of mischiefs. Exeunt.</p>
<h3>SCENE II. Camp near Sardis. Before Brutus' tent. Drum.</h3>
<p>Enter Brutus, Lucilius, Lucius, and Soldiers; Titinius and</p>
<p>Pindarus meet them.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Stand, ho!</p>
<p>LUCILIUS. Give the word, ho, and stand.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. What now, Lucilius, is Cassius near?</p>
<p>LUCILIUS. He is at hand, and Pindarus is come</p>
<p>To do you salutation from his master.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,</p>
<p>In his own change, or by ill officers,</p>
<p>Hath given me some worthy cause to wish</p>
<p>Things done undone; but if he be at hand,</p>
<p>I shall be satisfied.</p>
<p>PINDARUS. I do not doubt</p>
<p>But that my noble master will appear</p>
<p>Such as he is, full of regard and honor.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius,</p>
<p>How he received you. Let me be resolved.</p>
<p>LUCILIUS. With courtesy and with respect enough,</p>
<p>But not with such familiar instances,</p>
<p>Nor with such free and friendly conference,</p>
<p>As he hath used of old.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Thou hast described</p>
<p>A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,</p>
<p>When love begins to sicken and decay</p>
<p>It useth an enforced ceremony.</p>
<p>There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;</p>
<p>But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,</p>
<p>Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;</p>
<p>But when they should endure the bloody spur,</p>
<p>They fall their crests and like deceitful jades</p>
<p>Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?</p>
<p>LUCILIUS. They meant his night in Sard is to be quarter'd;</p>
<p>The greater part, the horse in general,</p>
<p>Are come with Cassius. Low march within.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Hark, he is arrived.</p>
<p>March gently on to meet him.</p>
<p>Enter Cassius and his Powers.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Stand, ho!</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Stand, ho! Speak the word along.</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER. Stand!</p>
<p>SECOND SOLDIER. Stand!</p>
<p>THIRD SOLDIER. Stand!</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Judge me, you gods! Wrong I mine enemies?</p>
<p>And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs,</p>
<p>And when you do them-</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Cassius, be content,</p>
<p>Speak your griefs softly, I do know you well.</p>
<p>Before the eyes of both our armies here,</p>
<p>Which should perceive nothing but love from us,</p>
<p>Let us not wrangle. Bid them move away;</p>
<p>Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,</p>
<p>And I will give you audience.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Pindarus,</p>
<p>Bid our commanders lead their charges off</p>
<p>A little from this ground.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Lucilius, do you the like, and let no man</p>
<p>Come to our tent till we have done our conference.</p>
<p>Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door. Exeunt.</p>
<h3>SCENE III. Brutus' tent.</h3>
<p>Enter Brutus and Cassius.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:</p>
<p>You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella</p>
<p>For taking bribes here of the Sardians,</p>
<p>Wherein my letters, praying on his side,</p>
<p>Because I knew the man, were slighted off.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. You wrong'd yourself to write in such a case.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. In such a time as this it is not meet</p>
<p>That every nice offense should bear his comment.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself</p>
<p>Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm,</p>
<p>To sell and mart your offices for gold</p>
<p>To undeservers.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. I an itching palm?</p>
<p>You know that you are Brutus that speaks this,</p>
<p>Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. The name of Cassius honors this corruption,</p>
<p>And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Chastisement?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Remember March, the ides of March remember.</p>
<p>Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?</p>
<p>What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,</p>
<p>And not for justice? What, shall one of us,</p>
<p>That struck the foremost man of all this world</p>
<p>But for supporting robbers, shall we now</p>
<p>Contaminate our fingers with base bribes</p>
<p>And sell the mighty space of our large honors</p>
<p>For so much trash as may be grasped thus?</p>
<p>I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,</p>
<p>Than such a Roman.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Brutus, bait not me,</p>
<p>I'll not endure it. You forget yourself</p>
<p>To hedge me in. I am a soldier, I,</p>
<p>Older in practice, abler than yourself</p>
<p>To make conditions.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Go to, you are not, Cassius.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. I am.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. I say you are not.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;</p>
<p>Have mind upon your health, tempt me no farther.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Away, slight man!</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Is't possible?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Hear me, for I will speak.</p>
<p>Must I give way and room to your rash choler?</p>
<p>Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?</p>
<p>CASSIUS. O gods, ye gods! Must I endure all this?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. All this? Ay, more. Fret till your proud heart break.</p>
<p>Go show your slaves how choleric you are,</p>
<p>And make your bondmen tremble. Must I bouge?</p>
<p>Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch</p>
<p>Under your testy humor? By the gods,</p>
<p>You shall digest the venom of your spleen,</p>
<p>Though it do split you, for, from this day forth,</p>
<p>I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,</p>
<p>When you are waspish.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Is it come to this?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. You say you are a better soldier:</p>
<p>Let it appear so, make your vaunting true,</p>
<p>And it shall please me well. For mine own part,</p>
<p>I shall be glad to learn of noble men.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.</p>
<p>I said, an elder soldier, not a better.</p>
<p>Did I say "better"?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. If you did, I care not.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. I durst not?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. No.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. What, durst not tempt him?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. For your life you durst not.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Do not presume too much upon my love;</p>
<p>I may do that I shall be sorry for.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. You have done that you should be sorry for.</p>
<p>There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,</p>
<p>For I am arm'd so strong in honesty,</p>
<p>That they pass by me as the idle wind</p>
<p>Which I respect not. I did send to you</p>
<p>For certain sums of gold, which you denied me,</p>
<p>For I can raise no money by vile means.</p>
<p>By heaven, I had rather coin my heart</p>
<p>And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring</p>
<p>From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash</p>
<p>By any indirection. I did send</p>
<p>To you for gold to pay my legions,</p>
<p>Which you denied me. Was that done like Cassius?</p>
<p>Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?</p>
<p>When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous</p>
<p>To lock such rascal counters from his friends,</p>
<p>Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,</p>
<p>Dash him to pieces!</p>
<p>CASSIUS. I denied you not.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. You did.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. I did not. He was but a fool</p>
<p>That brought my answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart.</p>
<p>A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,</p>
<p>But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. I do not, till you practise them on me.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. You love me not.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. I do not like your faults.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. A friendly eye could never see such faults.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. A flatterer's would not, though they do appear</p>
<p>As huge as high Olympus.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,</p>
<p>Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,</p>
<p>For Cassius is aweary of the world:</p>
<p>Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;</p>
<p>Check'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,</p>
<p>Set in a notebook, learn'd and conn'd by rote,</p>
<p>To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep</p>
<p>My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,</p>
<p>And here my naked breast; within, a heart</p>
<p>Dearer than Pluto's mine, richer than gold.</p>
<p>If that thou best a Roman, take it forth;</p>
<p>I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart.</p>
<p>Strike, as thou didst at Caesar, for I know,</p>
<p>When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better</p>
<p>Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Sheathe your dagger.</p>
<p>Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;</p>
<p>Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.</p>
<p>O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb,</p>
<p>That carries anger as the flint bears fire,</p>
<p>Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark</p>
<p>And straight is cold again.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Hath Cassius lived</p>
<p>To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,</p>
<p>When grief and blood ill-temper'd vexeth him?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. And my heart too.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. O Brutus!</p>
<p>BRUTUS. What's the matter?</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Have not you love enough to bear with me</p>
<p>When that rash humor which my mother gave me</p>
<p>Makes me forgetful?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth,</p>
<p>When you are overearnest with your Brutus,</p>
<p>He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.</p>
<p>POET. [Within.] Let me go in to see the generals.</p>
<p>There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet</p>
<p>They be alone.</p>
<p>LUCILIUS. [Within.] You shall not come to them.</p>
<p>POET. [Within.] Nothing but death shall stay me.</p>
<p>Enter Poet, followed by Lucilius, Titinius, and Lucius.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. How now, what's the matter?</p>
<p>POET. For shame, you generals! What do you mean?</p>
<p>Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;</p>
<p>For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Ha, ha! How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. I'll know his humor when he knows his time.</p>
<p>What should the wars do with these jigging fools?</p>
<p>Companion, hence!</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Away, away, be gone! Exit Poet.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders</p>
<p>Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. And come yourselves and bring Messala with you</p>
<p>Immediately to us. Exeunt Lucilius and Titinius.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Lucius, a bowl of wine! Exit Lucius.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. I did not think you could have been so angry.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Of your philosophy you make no use,</p>
<p>If you give place to accidental evils.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Ha? Portia?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. She is dead.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. How 'scaped killing when I cross'd you so?</p>
<p>O insupportable and touching loss!</p>
<p>Upon what sickness?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Impatient of my absence,</p>
<p>And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony</p>
<p>Have made themselves so strong- for with her death</p>
<p>That tidings came- with this she fell distract,</p>
<p>And (her attendants absent) swallow'd fire.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. And died so?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Even so.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. O ye immortal gods!</p>
<p>Re-enter Lucius, with wine and taper.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.</p>
<p>In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius. Drinks.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.</p>
<p>Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;</p>
<p>I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love. Drinks.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Come in, Titinius! Exit Lucius.</p>
<p>Re-enter Titinius, with Messala.</p>
<p>Welcome, good Messala.</p>
<p>Now sit we close about this taper here,</p>
<p>And call in question our necessities.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Portia, art thou gone?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. No more, I pray you.</p>
<p>Messala, I have here received letters</p>
<p>That young Octavius and Mark Antony</p>
<p>Come down upon us with a mighty power,</p>
<p>Bending their expedition toward Philippi.</p>
<p>MESSALA. Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. With what addition?</p>
<p>MESSALA. That by proscription and bills of outlawry</p>
<p>Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus</p>
<p>Have put to death an hundred senators.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. There in our letters do not well agree;</p>
<p>Mine speak of seventy senators that died</p>
<p>By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Cicero one!</p>
<p>MESSALA. Cicero is dead,</p>
<p>And by that order of proscription.</p>
<p>Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. No, Messala.</p>
<p>MESSALA. Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Nothing, Messala.</p>
<p>MESSALA. That, methinks, is strange.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours?</p>
<p>MESSALA. No, my lord.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.</p>
<p>MESSALA. Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:</p>
<p>For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.</p>
<p>With meditating that she must die once</p>
<p>I have the patience to endure it now.</p>
<p>MESSALA. Even so great men great losses should endure.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. I have as much of this in art as you,</p>
<p>But yet my nature could not bear it so.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Well, to our work alive. What do you think</p>
<p>Of marching to Philippi presently?</p>
<p>CASSIUS. I do not think it good.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Your reason?</p>
<p>CASSIUS. This it is:</p>
<p>'Tis better that the enemy seek us;</p>
<p>So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,</p>
<p>Doing himself offense, whilst we lying still</p>
<p>Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Good reasons must of force give place to better.</p>
<p>The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground</p>
<p>Do stand but in a forced affection,</p>
<p>For they have grudged us contribution.</p>
<p>The enemy, marching along by them,</p>
<p>By them shall make a fuller number up,</p>
<p>Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;</p>
<p>From which advantage shall we cut him off</p>
<p>If at Philippi we do face him there,</p>
<p>These people at our back.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Hear me, good brother.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Under your pardon. You must note beside</p>
<p>That we have tried the utmost of our friends,</p>
<p>Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:</p>
<p>The enemy increaseth every day;</p>
<p>We, at the height, are ready to decline.</p>
<p>There is a tide in the affairs of men</p>
<p>Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune;</p>
<p>Omitted, all the voyage of their life</p>
<p>Is bound in shallows and in miseries.</p>
<p>On such a full sea are we now afloat,</p>
<p>And we must take the current when it serves,</p>
<p>Or lose our ventures.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Then, with your will, go on;</p>
<p>We'll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. The deep of night is crept upon our talk,</p>
<p>And nature must obey necessity,</p>
<p>Which we will niggard with a little rest.</p>
<p>There is no more to say?</p>
<p>CASSIUS. No more. Good night.</p>
<p>Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Lucius!</p>
<p>Re-enter Lucius.</p>
<p>My gown. Exit Lucius.</p>
<p>Farewell, good Messala;</p>
<p>Good night, Titinius; noble, noble Cassius,</p>
<p>Good night and good repose.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. O my dear brother!</p>
<p>This was an ill beginning of the night.</p>
<p>Never come such division 'tween our souls!</p>
<p>Let it not, Brutus.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Everything is well.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Good night, my lord.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Good night, good brother.</p>
<p>TITINIUS. MESSALA. Good night, Lord Brutus.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Farewell, everyone.</p>
<p>Exeunt all but Brutus.</p>
<p>Re-enter Lucius, with the gown.</p>
<p>Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?</p>
<p>LUCIUS. Here in the tent.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. What, thou speak'st drowsily?</p>
<p>Poor knave, I blame thee not, thou art o'erwatch'd.</p>
<p>Call Claudio and some other of my men,</p>
<p>I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.</p>
<p>LUCIUS. Varro and Claudio!</p>
<p>Enter Varro and Claudio.</p>
<p>VARRO. Calls my lord?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;</p>
<p>It may be I shall raise you by and by</p>
<p>On business to my brother Cassius.</p>
<p>VARRO. So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. I would not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.</p>
<p>It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.</p>
<p>Look Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;</p>
<p>I put it in the pocket of my gown.</p>
<p>Varro and Claudio lie down.</p>
<p>LUCIUS. I was sure your lordship did not give it me.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.</p>
<p>Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,</p>
<p>And touch thy instrument a strain or two?</p>
<p>LUCIUS. Ay, my lord, an't please you.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. It does, my boy.</p>
<p>I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.</p>
<p>LUCIUS. It is my duty, sir.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. I should not urge thy duty past thy might;</p>
<p>I know young bloods look for a time of rest.</p>
<p>LUCIUS. I have slept, my lord, already.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;</p>
<p>I will not hold thee long. If I do live,</p>
<p>I will be good to thee. Music, and a song.</p>
<p>This is a sleepy tune. O murtherous slumber,</p>
<p>Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy</p>
<p>That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night.</p>
<p>I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.</p>
<p>If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;</p>
<p>I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.</p>
<p>Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down</p>
<p>Where I left reading? Here it is, I think. Sits down.</p>
<p>Enter the Ghost of Caesar.</p>
<p>How ill this taper burns! Ha, who comes here?</p>
<p>I think it is the weakness of mine eyes</p>
<p>That shapes this monstrous apparition.</p>
<p>It comes upon me. Art thou anything?</p>
<p>Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil</p>
<p>That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?</p>
<p>Speak to me what thou art.</p>
<p>GHOST. Thy evil spirit, Brutus.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Why comest thou?</p>
<p>GHOST. To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Well, then I shall see thee again?</p>
<p>GHOST. Ay, at Philippi.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Why, I will see thee at Philippi then. Exit Ghost.</p>
<p>Now I have taken heart thou vanishest.</p>
<p>Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.</p>
<p>Boy! Lucius! Varro! Claudio! Sirs, awake!</p>
<p>Claudio!</p>
<p>LUCIUS. The strings, my lord, are false.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. He thinks he still is at his instrument.</p>
<p>Lucius, awake!</p>
<p>LUCIUS. My lord?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?</p>
<p>LUCIUS. My lord, I do not know that I did cry.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything?</p>
<p>LUCIUS. Nothing, my lord.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudio!</p>
<p>[To Varro.] Fellow thou, awake!</p>
<p>VARRO. My lord?</p>
<p>CLAUDIO. My lord?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?</p>
<p>VARRO. CLAUDIO. Did we, my lord?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Ay, saw you anything?</p>
<p>VARRO. No, my lord, I saw nothing.</p>
<p>CLAUDIO. Nor I, my lord.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;</p>
<p>Bid him set on his powers betimes before,</p>
<p>And we will follow.</p>
<p>VARRO. CLAUDIO. It shall be done, my lord. Exeunt.</p>

<h3>ACT V. SCENE I. The plains of Philippi.</h3>
<p>Enter Octavius, Antony, and their Army.</p>
<p>OCTAVIUS. Now, Antony, our hopes are answered.</p>
<p>You said the enemy would not come down,</p>
<p>But keep the hills and upper regions.</p>
<p>It proves not so. Their battles are at hand;</p>
<p>They mean to warn us at Philippi here,</p>
<p>Answering before we do demand of them.</p>
<p>ANTONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know</p>
<p>Wherefore they do it. They could be content</p>
<p>To visit other places, and come down</p>
<p>With fearful bravery, thinking by this face</p>
<p>To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;</p>
<p>But 'tis not so.</p>
<p>Enter a Messenger.</p>
<p>MESSENGER. Prepare you, generals.</p>
<p>The enemy comes on in gallant show;</p>
<p>Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,</p>
<p>And something to be done immediately.</p>
<p>ANTONY. Octavius, lead your battle softly on,</p>
<p>Upon the left hand of the even field.</p>
<p>OCTAVIUS. Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.</p>
<p>ANTONY. Why do you cross me in this exigent?</p>
<p>OCTAVIUS. I do not cross you, but I will do so.</p>
<p>March. Drum. Enter Brutus, Cassius, and their Army;</p>
<p>Lucilius, Titinius, Messala, and others.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. They stand, and would have parley.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.</p>
<p>OCTAVIUS. Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?</p>
<p>ANTONY. No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.</p>
<p>Make forth, the generals would have some words.</p>
<p>OCTAVIUS. Stir not until the signal not until the signal.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Words before blows. Is it so, countrymen?</p>
<p>OCTAVIUS. Not that we love words better, as you do.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.</p>
<p>ANTONY. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.</p>
<p>Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,</p>
<p>Crying "Long live! Hail, Caesar!"</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Antony,</p>
<p>The posture of your blows are yet unknown;</p>
<p>But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,</p>
<p>And leave them honeyless.</p>
<p>ANTONY. Not stingless too.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. O, yes, and soundless too,</p>
<p>For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,</p>
<p>And very wisely threat before you sting.</p>
<p>ANTONY. Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers</p>
<p>Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar.</p>
<p>You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,</p>
<p>And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;</p>
<p>Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind</p>
<p>Strooke Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Flatterers? Now, Brutus, thank yourself.</p>
<p>This tongue had not offended so today,</p>
<p>If Cassius might have ruled.</p>
<p>OCTAVIUS. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,</p>
<p>The proof of it will turn to redder drops.</p>
<p>Look,</p>
<p>I draw a sword against conspirators;</p>
<p>When think you that the sword goes up again?</p>
<p>Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds</p>
<p>Be well avenged, or till another Caesar</p>
<p>Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,</p>
<p>Unless thou bring'st them with thee.</p>
<p>OCTAVIUS. So I hope,</p>
<p>I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,</p>
<p>Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. A peevish school boy, worthless of such honor,</p>
<p>Join'd with a masker and a reveler!</p>
<p>ANTONY. Old Cassius still!</p>
<p>OCTAVIUS. Come, Antony, away!</p>
<p>Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.</p>
<p>If you dare fight today, come to the field;</p>
<p>If not, when you have stomachs.</p>
<p>Exeunt Octavius, Antony, and their Army.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Why, now, blow and, swell billow, and swim bark!</p>
<p>The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you.</p>
<p>LUCILIUS. [Stands forth.] My lord?</p>
<p>Brutus and Lucilius converse apart.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Messala!</p>
<p>MESSALA. [Stands forth.] What says my general?</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Messala,</p>
<p>This is my birthday, as this very day</p>
<p>Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala.</p>
<p>Be thou my witness that, against my will,</p>
<p>As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set</p>
<p>Upon one battle all our liberties.</p>
<p>You know that I held Epicurus strong,</p>
<p>And his opinion. Now I change my mind,</p>
<p>And partly credit things that do presage.</p>
<p>Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign</p>
<p>Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,</p>
<p>Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands,</p>
<p>Who to Philippi here consorted us.</p>
<p>This morning are they fled away and gone,</p>
<p>And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites</p>
<p>Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,</p>
<p>As we were sickly prey. Their shadows seem</p>
<p>A canopy most fatal, under which</p>
<p>Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.</p>
<p>MESSALA. Believe not so.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. I but believe it partly,</p>
<p>For I am fresh of spirit and resolved</p>
<p>To meet all perils very constantly.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Even so, Lucilius.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Now, most noble Brutus,</p>
<p>The gods today stand friendly that we may,</p>
<p>Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!</p>
<p>But, since the affairs of men rest still incertain,</p>
<p>Let's reason with the worst that may befall.</p>
<p>If we do lose this battle, then is this</p>
<p>The very last time we shall speak together.</p>
<p>What are you then determined to do?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Even by the rule of that philosophy</p>
<p>By which I did blame Cato for the death</p>
<p>Which he did give himself- I know not how,</p>
<p>But I do find it cowardly and vile,</p>
<p>For fear of what might fall, so to prevent</p>
<p>The time of life- arming myself with patience</p>
<p>To stay the providence of some high powers</p>
<p>That govern us below.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Then, if we lose this battle,</p>
<p>You are contented to be led in triumph</p>
<p>Thorough the streets of Rome?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,</p>
<p>That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;</p>
<p>He bears too great a mind. But this same day</p>
<p>Must end that work the ides of March begun.</p>
<p>And whether we shall meet again I know not.</p>
<p>Therefore our everlasting farewell take.</p>
<p>Forever, and forever, farewell, Cassius!</p>
<p>If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;</p>
<p>If not, why then this parting was well made.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Forever and forever farewell, Brutus!</p>
<p>If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;</p>
<p>If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Why then, lead on. O, that a man might know</p>
<p>The end of this day's business ere it come!</p>
<p>But it sufficeth that the day will end,</p>
<p>And then the end is known. Come, ho! Away! Exeunt.</p>
<h3>SCENE II. The field of battle.</h3>
<p>Alarum. Enter Brutus and Messala.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills</p>
<p>Unto the legions on the other side. Loud alarum.</p>
<p>Let them set on at once, for I perceive</p>
<p>But cold demeanor in Octavia's wing,</p>
<p>And sudden push gives them the overthrow.</p>
<p>Ride, ride, Messala. Let them all come down. Exeunt.</p>
<h3>SCENE III. Another part of the field.</h3>
<p>Alarums. Enter Cassius and Titinius.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!</p>
<p>Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy.</p>
<p>This ensign here of mine was turning back;</p>
<p>I slew the coward, and did take it from him.</p>
<p>TITINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,</p>
<p>Who, having some advantage on Octavius,</p>
<p>Took it too eagerly. His soldiers fell to spoil,</p>
<p>Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.</p>
<p>Enter Pindarus.</p>
<p>PINDARUS. Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;</p>
<p>Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord;</p>
<p>Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius:</p>
<p>Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?</p>
<p>TITINIUS. They are, my lord.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Titinius, if thou lovest me,</p>
<p>Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him,</p>
<p>Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops</p>
<p>And here again, that I may rest assured</p>
<p>Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.</p>
<p>TITINIUS. I will be here again, even with a thought. Exit.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;</p>
<p>My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,</p>
<p>And tell me what thou notest about the field.</p>
<p>Pindarus ascends the hill.</p>
<p>This day I breathed first: time is come round,</p>
<p>And where I did begin, there shall I end;</p>
<p>My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?</p>
<p>PINDARUS. [Above.] O my lord!</p>
<p>CASSIUS. What news?</p>
<p>PINDARUS. [Above.] Titinius is enclosed round about</p>
<p>With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;</p>
<p>Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.</p>
<p>Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.</p>
<p>He's ta'en [Shout.] And, hark! They shout for joy.</p>
<p>CASSIUS. Come down; behold no more.</p>
<p>O, coward that I am, to live so long,</p>
<p>To see my best friend ta'en before my face!</p>
<p>Pindarus descends.</p>
<p>Come hither, sirrah.</p>
<p>In Parthia did I take thee prisoner,</p>
<p>And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,</p>
<p>That whatsoever I did bid thee do,</p>
<p>Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;</p>
<p>Now be a freeman, and with this good sword,</p>
<p>That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.</p>
<p>Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;</p>
<p>And when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,</p>
<p>Guide thou the sword. [Pindarus stabs him.] Caesar, thou art</p>
<p>revenged,</p>
<p>Even with the sword that kill'd thee. Dies.</p>
<p>PINDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been,</p>
<p>Durst I have done my will. O Cassius!</p>
<p>Far from this country Pindarus shall run,</p>
<p>Where never Roman shall take note of him. Exit.</p>
<p>Re-enter Titinius with Messala.</p>
<p>MESSALA. It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius</p>
<p>Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,</p>
<p>As Cassius' legions are by Antony.</p>
<p>TITINIUS. These tidings would well comfort Cassius.</p>
<p>MESSALA. Where did you leave him?</p>
<p>TITINIUS. All disconsolate,</p>
<p>With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.</p>
<p>MESSALA. Is not that he that lies upon the ground?</p>
<p>TITINIUS. He lies not like the living. O my heart!</p>
<p>MESSALA. Is not that he?</p>
<p>TITINIUS. No, this was he, Messala,</p>
<p>But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,</p>
<p>As in thy red rays thou dost sink to night,</p>
<p>So in his red blood Cassius' day is set,</p>
<p>The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;</p>
<p>Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!</p>
<p>Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.</p>
<p>MESSALA. Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.</p>
<p>O hateful error, melancholy's child,</p>
<p>Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men</p>
<p>The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,</p>
<p>Thou never comest unto a happy birth,</p>
<p>But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!</p>
<p>TITINIUS. What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?</p>
<p>MESSALA. Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet</p>
<p>The noble Brutus, thrusting this report</p>
<p>Into his ears. I may say "thrusting" it,</p>
<p>For piercing steel and darts envenomed</p>
<p>Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus</p>
<p>As tidings of this sight.</p>
<p>TITINIUS. Hie you, Messala,</p>
<p>And I will seek for Pindarus the while. Exit Messala.</p>
<p>Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?</p>
<p>Did I not meet thy friends? And did not they</p>
<p>Put on my brows this wreath of victory,</p>
<p>And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?</p>
<p>Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything!</p>
<p>But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;</p>
<p>Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I</p>
<p>Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,</p>
<p>And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.</p>
<p>By your leave, gods, this is a Roman's part.</p>
<p>Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.</p>
<p>Kills himself.</p>
<p>Alarum. Re-enter Messala, with Brutus, young Cato,</p>
<p>and others.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?</p>
<p>MESSALA. Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Titinius' face is upward.</p>
<p>CATO. He is slain.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!</p>
<p>Thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords</p>
<p>In our own proper entrails. Low alarums.</p>
<p>CATO. Brave Titinius!</p>
<p>Look whe'er he have not crown'd dead Cassius!</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Are yet two Romans living such as these?</p>
<p>The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!</p>
<p>It is impossible that ever Rome</p>
<p>Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe moe tears</p>
<p>To this dead man than you shall see me pay.</p>
<p>I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.</p>
<p>Come therefore, and to Thasos send his body;</p>
<p>His funerals shall not be in our camp,</p>
<p>Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come,</p>
<p>And come, young Cato; let us to the field.</p>
<p>Labio and Flavio, set our battles on.</p>
<p>'Tis three o'clock, and Romans, yet ere night</p>
<p>We shall try fortune in a second fight. Exeunt.</p>
<h3>SCENE IV. Another part of the field.</h3>
<p>Alarum. Enter, fighting, Soldiers of both armies; then Brutus,</p>
<p>young Cato,</p>
<p>Lucilius, and others.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!</p>
<p>CATO. What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?</p>
<p>I will proclaim my name about the field.</p>
<p>I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!</p>
<p>A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend.</p>
<p>I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!</p>
<p>BRUTUS. And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;</p>
<p>Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus! Exit.</p>
<p>LUCILIUS. O young and noble Cato, art thou down?</p>
<p>Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius,</p>
<p>And mayst be honor'd, being Cato's son.</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER. Yield, or thou diest.</p>
<p>LUCILIUS. Only I yield to die.</p>
<p>[Offers money.] There is so much that thou wilt kill me</p>
<p>straight:</p>
<p>Kill Brutus, and be honor'd in his death.</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER. We must not. A noble prisoner!</p>
<p>SECOND SOLDIER. Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.</p>
<p>FIRST SOLDIER. I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.</p>
<p>Enter Antony.</p>
<p>Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.</p>
<p>ANTONY. Where is he?</p>
<p>LUCILIUS. Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough.</p>
<p>I dare assure thee that no enemy</p>
<p>Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus;</p>
<p>The gods defend him from so great a shame!</p>
<p>When you do find him, or alive or dead,</p>
<p>He will be found like Brutus, like himself.</p>
<p>ANTONY. This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,</p>
<p>A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe,</p>
<p>Give him all kindness; I had rather have</p>
<p>Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,</p>
<p>And see wheer Brutus be alive or dead,</p>
<p>And bring us word unto Octavius' tent</p>
<p>How everything is chanced. Exeunt.</p>
<h3>SCENE V. Another part of the field.</h3>
<p>Enter Brutus, Dardanius, Clitus, Strato, and Volumnius.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.</p>
<p>CLITUS. Statilius show'd the torchlight, but, my lord,</p>
<p>He came not back. He is or ta'en or slain.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word:</p>
<p>It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus. Whispers.</p>
<p>CLITUS. What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Peace then, no words.</p>
<p>CLITUS. I'll rather kill myself.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Hark thee, Dardanius. Whispers.</p>
<p>DARDANIUS. Shall I do such a deed?</p>
<p>CLITUS. O Dardanius!</p>
<p>DARDANIUS. O Clitus!</p>
<p>CLITUS. What ill request did Brutus make to thee?</p>
<p>DARDANIUS. To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.</p>
<p>CLITUS. Now is that noble vessel full of grief,</p>
<p>That it runs over even at his eyes.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word.</p>
<p>VOLUMNIUS. What says my lord?</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Why, this, Volumnius:</p>
<p>The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me</p>
<p>Two several times by night; at Sardis once,</p>
<p>And this last night here in Philippi fields.</p>
<p>I know my hour is come.</p>
<p>VOLUMNIUS. Not so, my lord.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius.</p>
<p>Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;</p>
<p>Our enemies have beat us to the pit; Low alarums.</p>
<p>It is more worthy to leap in ourselves</p>
<p>Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,</p>
<p>Thou know'st that we two went to school together;</p>
<p>Even for that our love of old, I prithee,</p>
<p>Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.</p>
<p>VOLUMNIUS. That's not an office for a friend, my lord.</p>
<p>Alarum still.</p>
<p>CLITUS. Fly, fly, my lord, there is no tarrying here.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius.</p>
<p>Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;</p>
<p>Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,</p>
<p>My heart doth joy that yet in all my life</p>
<p>I found no man but he was true to me.</p>
<p>I shall have glory by this losing day,</p>
<p>More than Octavius and Mark Antony</p>
<p>By this vile conquest shall attain unto.</p>
<p>So, fare you well at once, for Brutus' tongue</p>
<p>Hath almost ended his life's history.</p>
<p>Night hangs upon mine eyes, my bones would rest</p>
<p>That have but labor'd to attain this hour.</p>
<p>Alarum. Cry within, "Fly, fly, fly!"</p>
<p>CLITUS. Fly, my lord, fly.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Hence! I will follow.</p>
<p>Exeunt Clitus, Dardanius, and Volumnius.</p>
<p>I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord.</p>
<p>Thou art a fellow of a good respect;</p>
<p>Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it.</p>
<p>Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,</p>
<p>While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?</p>
<p>STRATO. Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.</p>
<p>BRUTUS. Farewell, good Strato. Runs on his sword.</p>
<p>Caesar, now be still;</p>
<p>I kill'd not thee with half so good a will. Dies.</p>
<p>Alarum. Retreat. Enter Octavius, Antony, Messala,</p>
<p>Lucilius, and the Army.</p>
<p>OCTAVIUS. What man is that?</p>
<p>MESSALA. My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?</p>
<p>STRATO. Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:</p>
<p>The conquerors can but make a fire of him;</p>
<p>For Brutus only overcame himself,</p>
<p>And no man else hath honor by his death.</p>
<p>LUCILIUS. So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,</p>
<p>That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.</p>
<p>OCTAVIUS. All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.</p>
<p>Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?</p>
<p>STRATO. Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.</p>
<p>OCTAVIUS. Do so, good Messala.</p>
<p>MESSALA. How died my master, Strato?</p>
<p>STRATO. I held the sword, and he did run on it.</p>
<p>MESSALA. Octavius, then take him to follow thee</p>
<p>That did the latest service to my master.</p>
<p>ANTONY. This was the noblest Roman of them all.</p>
<p>All the conspirators, save only he,</p>
<p>Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;</p>
<p>He only, in a general honest thought</p>
<p>And common good to all, made one of them.</p>
<p>His life was gentle, and the elements</p>
<p>So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up</p>
<p>And say to all the world, "This was a man!"</p>
<p>OCTAVIUS. According to his virtue let us use him</p>
<p>With all respect and rites of burial.</p>
<p>Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie,</p>
<p>Most like a soldier, ordered honorably.</p>
<p>So call the field to rest, and let's away,</p>
<p>To part the glories of this happy day. Exeunt.</p>
<h4>THE END</h4></body>
