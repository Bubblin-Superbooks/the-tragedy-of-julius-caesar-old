Ever note, Lucilius,</p><p>When love begins to sicken and decay</p><p>It useth an enforced ceremony.</p><p>There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;</p><p>But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,</p><p>Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;</p><p>But when they should endure the bloody spur,</p><p>They fall their crests and like deceitful jades</p><p>Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?</p></div> </div>
